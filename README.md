Dolma is two things:

1. **Dolma Dataset**: an open dataset of 3 trillion tokens from a diverse mix of web content, academic publications, code, books, and encyclopedic materials.
2. **Dolma Toolkit**: a high-performance toolkit for curating datasets for language modeling.

## Dolma Dataset

Dolma is an open dataset of 3 trillion tokens from a diverse mix of web content, academic publications, code, books, and encyclopedic materials.
It was created as a training corpus for [OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo), a language model from the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org) (AI2).

Dolma is available for download on the HuggingFace ü§ó Hub: [`huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/dolma`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/dolma). To access Dolma, users must agree to the terms of the terms of [AI2 ImpACT License for Medium Risk Artifacts](https://allenai.org/licenses/impact-mr). Once agreed you can follow the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/dolma#download) to download it.

You can also read more about Dolma in [our announcement](https://blog.allenai.org/dolma-3-trillion-tokens-open-llm-corpus-9a0ff4b8da64), as well as by consulting its [data sheet](docs/assets/dolma-datasheet-v0.1.pdf).


## Dolma Toolkit

Dolma is a toolkit to curate large datasets for (pre)-training ML models. Its key features are:

1. **High Performance** ‚ö°: Can process billions of documents concurrently thanks to built-in parallelism.
2. **Portabilty** üß≥: Works on a single machine, a cluster, or cloud environment.
3. **Built-In Taggers** üè∑: Includes ready-to-use taggers commonly used to curate datasets such as [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446), [C4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683), and [OpenWebText](https://openwebtext2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
4. **Fast Deduplication** üóë: Speedy document deduplication using a Rust Bloom filter.
5. **Extensibility** üß© & **Cloud Support** ‚òÅ: Supports custom taggers and AWS S3-compatible locations.

To install, simply type `pip install dolma` in your terminal.
