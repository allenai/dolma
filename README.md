Dolma is two things:

1. **Dolma Dataset**: an open dataset of 3 trillion tokens from a diverse mix of web content, academic publications, code, books, and encyclopedic materials.
2. **Dolma Toolkit**: a high-performance toolkit for curating datasets for language modeling -- this repo contains the source code for the Dolma Toolkit.

## Dolma Dataset

Dolma is an open dataset of 3 trillion tokens from a diverse mix of web content, academic publications, code, books, and encyclopedic materials.
It was created as a training corpus for [OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo), a language model from the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org) (AI2).

Dolma is available for download on the HuggingFace ü§ó Hub: [`huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/dolma`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/dolma). Dolma is licensed under **[ODC-BY](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/)**; see our [blog post](https://blog.allenai.org/making-a-switch-dolma-moves-to-odc-by-8f0e73852f44) for explanation.

You can also read more about Dolma in [our announcement](https://blog.allenai.org/dolma-3-trillion-tokens-open-llm-corpus-9a0ff4b8da64), as well as by consulting its [data sheet](docs/assets/dolma-v0_1-20230819.pdf).


## Dolma Toolkit

This repository houses the Dolma Toolkit, which enables curation of large datasets for (pre)-training ML models. Its key features are:

1. **High Performance** ‚ö°: Can process billions of documents concurrently thanks to built-in parallelism.
2. **Portability** üß≥: Works on a single machine, a cluster, or cloud environment.
3. **Built-In Taggers** üè∑: Includes ready-to-use taggers commonly used to curate datasets such as [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446), [C4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683), and [OpenWebText](https://openwebtext2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
4. **Fast Deduplication** üóë: Speedy document deduplication using a Rust Bloom filter.
5. **Extensibility** üß© & **Cloud Support** ‚òÅ: Supports custom taggers and AWS S3-compatible locations.

To install, simply type `pip install dolma` in your terminal.

## Development

The Dolma Toolkit is a mixed Python/Rust project that uses [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) for building. Here's how to set up a development environment:

### Using uv (Recommended)

If you're using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the easiest way to work with the codebase is:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/allenai/dolma.git
   cd dolma
   ```

2. **Run dolma commands during development:**
   ```bash
   # For regular use (caches builds)
   uv run dolma --version
   
   # After making Rust changes (rebuilds if needed)
   uv run --reinstall-package dolma dolma --version
   ```

3. **Create a development alias (optional):**
   ```bash
   alias dolma-dev="uv run --reinstall-package dolma dolma"
   # Then use: dolma-dev --version
   ```

### Using pip/conda

If you're not using uv:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/allenai/dolma.git
   cd dolma
   ```

2. **Install maturin and build dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install maturin[patchelf]  # Linux
   pip install maturin           # macOS/Windows
   ```

3. **Build and install in development mode:**
   ```bash
   # Initial build
   maturin develop --release
   
   # After making Rust changes, rebuild
   maturin develop --release
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Version Management

This project uses a unified versioning system where:
- The version is defined in `Cargo.toml` (Rust)
- Python dynamically reads the version from the Rust extension
- Both `dolma --version` and `import dolma; dolma.__version__` show the same version

To update the version, simply change it in `Cargo.toml` and rebuild.
