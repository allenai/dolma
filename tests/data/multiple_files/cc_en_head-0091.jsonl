In my opinion anyway.\nThe argument is a waste of time, to me, because it's one of those discussions that could go on and on and on and on and on, and ultimately, you never come to a conclusion. Reason being, there's no video (to date) that shows it.\nSo, I focus on different things... which people are tired of hearing me say, but that's the way it is.\nHow is it possible that 34 minutes after the SECOND tower was hit, when even Joe Schmoe's like me knew America was \"under attack\", that a hijacked plane with kamikaze pilots managed to penetrate Washington D.C. airspace, the most defended airspace in the world? Don't you think it would have been intelligent of them to deploy fighters over the skies of D.C. RIGHT when the attacks occurred? Why weren't they? Who was in charge of making those kinds of decisions?\nNorman Mineta testified that he arrived at the Presidential Emergency Operations Center at 9:20, and Dick Cheney was already there. By 9:25, a young man came in and out of the room three times to tell Cheney the position of Flight 77, and asked for confirmation of orders. Orders that couldn't have been a \"shoot-down\" order because according to the latest Vanity Fair piece, fighter pilots claimed by 10:10:31, they had, \"negative clearance to fire.\" So what order was it? Who is the young man, and why didn't he testify before the 9/11 Commission? Why did Dick Cheney claim that he had given a \"shoot down\" order? Why did the 9/11 Commission claim that Dick Cheney arrived at the PEOC by 9:58am? Why did the 9/11 Report completely omit Norman Mineta's testimony?\nObviously, details like inept patsies and protective moles leading to multi-billion-dollar defense failures and ultimately \"Angel is next\" are much harder to deal with than throwing the Popular Mechanics propeller heads at Dylan Avery and crew. For any of the leadership to go off SOP while the \"nation is under attack\" is treasonable. They will testify only with the threat of the noose before them. Treason for the lot of them!\nblog dog (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 7:44pm.\nI'd rather be proven wrong than right.

They describe it as a possible crash. The center waits 16 minutes before passing the information to FAA headquarters at 9:25 a.m. (see 9:25 a.m.) [Washington Post, 11/3/2001; 9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004] However, American Airlines headquarters has been notified of the same information before 9:00 a.m. (see (Before 9:00 a.m.)).\nAccording to counterterrorism “tsar” Richard Clarke and others, Vice President Cheney goes from his White House office to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC), a bunker in the East Wing of the White House, at about this time. National Security Adviser Rice, after initiating a video conference with Richard Clarke in the West Wing, goes to the PEOC to be with Cheney. There is no video link between response centers in the East and West Wings, but a secure telephone line is used instead. [Clarke, 2004, pp. 3-4; ABC News, 9/14/2002; New York Times, 9/16/2001; Daily Telegraph, 12/16/2001] One eyewitness account, David Bohrer, a White House photographer, says Cheney leaves for the PEOC just after 9:00 a.m. [ABC News, 9/14/2002] However, there is a second account claiming that Cheney doesn’t leave until sometime after 9:30 a.m. In this account, Secret Service agents burst into Cheney’s White House office. They carry him under his arms—nearly lifting him off the ground—and propel him down the steps into the White House basement and through a long tunnel toward an underground bunker. [Washington Post, 1/27/2002; BBC, 9/1/2002; Newsweek, 12/31/2001; New York Times, 10/16/2001; MSNBC, 9/11/2002; 9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004] At about the same time, National Security Adviser Rice is told to go to the bunker as well. [ABC News, 9/11/2002] In addition to the eyewitness accounts of Clarke and Bohrer, ABC News claims that Cheney is in the bunker when he is told Flight 77 is 50 miles away from Washington at 9:27 a.m., suggesting that accounts of Cheney entering the bunker after 9:27 a.m. are likely incorrect.\nRenee May, a flight attendant on Flight 77, uses a cell phone to call her mother in Las Vegas. She tells her mother that the flight has been hijacked, and that everyone has been asked to move to the back of the plane. She asks her mother to call American Airlines and let them know Flight 77 has been hijacked. Her mother (Nancy May) calls the airline. [Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9/13/2001; Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9/15/2001; 9/11 Commission, 1/27/2004; San Francisco Chronicle, 7/23/2004] American Airlines headquarters is already aware that Flight 77 is hijacked, but supposedly Indianapolis flight control covering the flight still is not told.\nIn a government report analyzing the effectiveness of rescue worker response to the Pentagon crash, it is mentioned that, “At about 9:20 a.m., the WFO [FBI Washington Field Office] Command Center [is] notified that American Airlines Flight 77 had been hijacked shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport. [Special Agent in Charge Arthur] Eberhart dispatche[s] a team of 50 agents to investigate the Dulles hijacking and provide additional security to prevent another. He sen[ds] a second team to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport as a precautionary step. At the WFO Command Center, Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) Jim Rice [is] on the telephone with the Pentagon when Flight 77 crashe[s] into the building.” [US Department of Health and Human Services, 7/2002] Yet according to the 9/11 Commission, NORAD is not told that Flight 77 had been hijacked at this time or any time before it crashes. However, the FAA has claimed they officially warned NORAD at 9:24 a.m. (see (9:24 a.m.)) and informally warned them even earlier (see (9:24 a.m.)).\nA passenger on Flight 77, Barbara Olson, calls her husband, Theodore (Ted) Olson, who is Solicitor General at the Justice Department. [San Francisco Chronicle, 7/23/2004] Ted Olson is in his Justice Department office watching WTC news on television when his wife calls. A few days later, he says, “She told me that she had been herded to the back of the plane. She mentioned that they had used knives and box cutters to hijack the plane. She mentioned that the pilot had announced that the plane had been hijacked.” [CNN, 9/14/2001] He tells her that two planes have hit the WTC. [Daily Telegraph, 3/5/2002] She feels nobody is taking charge. [CNN, 9/12/2001] He doesn’t know if she was near the pilots, but at one point she asks, “What shall I tell the pilot? What can I tell the pilot to do?” [CNN, 9/14/2001] Then she is cut off without warning. [Newsweek, 9/29/2001] Ted Olson’s recollection of the call’s timing is extremely vague, saying it “must have been 9:15 [am.] or 9:30 [am.]. Someone would have to reconstruct the time for me.” [CNN, 9/14/2001] Other accounts place it around 9:25 a.m. [Miami Herald, 9/14/2001; New York Times, 9/15/2001; Washington Post, 9/21/2001] The call is said to have lasted about a minute. [Washington Post, 9/12/2001] By some accounts, his message that planes have hit the WTC comes later, in a second phone call. [Washington Post, 9/21/2001] In one account, Barbara Olson calls from inside a bathroom. [Evening Standard, 9/12/2001] In another account, she is near a pilot, and in yet another she is near two pilots. [Boston Globe, 11/23/2001] Ted Olson’s account of how Barbara Olson made her calls is also conflicting. Three days after 9/11, he says, “I found out later that she was having, for some reason, to call collect and was having trouble getting through. You know how it is to get through to a government institution when you’re calling collect.” He says he doesn’t know what kind of phone she used, but he has “assumed that it must have been on the airplane phone, and that she somehow didn’t have access to her credit cards. Otherwise, she would have used her cell phone and called me.” [Hannity & Colmes, 9/14/2001] Why Barbara Olson would have needed access to her credit cards to call him on her cell phone is not explained. However, in another interview on the same day, he says that she used a cell phone and that she may have been cut off “because the signals from cell phones coming from airplanes don’t work that well.” [CNN, 9/14/2001] Six months later, he claims she called collect “using the phone in the passengers’ seats.” [Daily Telegraph, 3/5/2002] However, it is not possible to call on seatback phones, collect or otherwise, without a credit card, which would render making a collect call moot. Many other details are conflicting, and Olson faults his memory and says that he “tends to mix the two [calls] up because of the emotion of the events.” [CNN, 9/14/2001] The couple liked to joke that they were at the heart of what Hillary Clinton famously called a “vast, right-wing conspiracy.” Ted Olson has been a controversial choice as Solicitor General since he argued on behalf of Bush before the Supreme Court in the 2000 presidential election controversy before being nominated for his current position.\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission, the FAA Command Center advises the Dulles Airport terminal control facility in Washington to look for primary targets. [9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004] By at least one account, Dulles notices Flight 77 a few minutes later.\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission, the FAA Command Center advises FAA headquarters that American 77 is lost in Indianapolis flight control’s airspace, that Indianapolis has no primary radar track, and is looking for the aircraft. [9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004] The Command Center had learned this 16 minutes earlier at 9:09 a.m. (see 9:09 a.m.). American Airlines headquarters was notified of the same information before 9:00 a.m. (see (Before 9:00 a.m.)).\nRadar tracks Flight 77 as it closes within 30 miles of Washington. [CBS News, 9/21/2001] Todd Lewis, flight controller at Washington’s Dulles Airport, later recalls, “... my colleagues saw a target moving quite fast from the northwest to the southeast. So she—we all started watching that target, and she notified the supervisor. However, nobody knew that was a commercial flight at the time. Nobody knew that was American 77. ... I thought it was a military flight.” [MSNBC, 9/11/2002] Another account is similar, saying that just before 9:30 a.m., a Dulles Airport controller sees an aircraft without a transponder traveling almost 500 mph headed toward Washington. [USA Today, 8/13/2002] In yet another account, Danielle O’Brien, the Dulles flight controller said to be the first to spot the blip, claims she doesn’t spot it until it is around 12 to 14 miles from Washington. [ABC News, 10/24/2001; ABC News, 10/24/2001] There are also accounts that Vice President Cheney is told around 9:27 a.m. that radar is tracking Flight 77, 50 miles away from Washington. The 9/11 Commission says the plane isn’t discovered until 9:32 a.m.\n(9:30 a.m.): Who Warns Who of Flight 77’s Impending Approach to D.C.?\nThe three Langley fighters are airborne, but just where they go and how fast are in dispute. There are varying accounts that the fighters are ordered to Washington, New York, Baltimore, or no destination at all. The 9/11 Commission Reports that, in fact, the pilots don’t understand there is an emergency and head east. They give three reasons. “First, unlike a normal scramble order, this order did not include a distance to the target, or the target’s location. Second, a ‘generic’ flight plan incorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were ordered to fly due east (090) for 60 miles. The purpose of the generic flight plan was to quickly get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace. Third, the lead pilot and local FAA controller incorrectly assumed the flight plan instruction to go ‘090 for 60’ was newer guidance that superseded the original scramble order.” [9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004] However, the Wall Street Journal gives a different explanation, surprisingly from 9/11 Commission testimony. “Once they got in the air, the Langley fighters observed peacetime noise restrictions requiring that they fly more slowly than supersonic speed and takeoff over water, pointed away from Washington, according to testimony before the [9/11 Commission].” The fighters that departed to New York City over 30 minutes earlier at 8:52 a.m. (see 8:52 a.m.) traveled faster than supersonic because they realized they were in a national emergency. [Wall Street Journal, 3/22/2004 ] In 2003 testimony, NORAD Commander Major General Larry Arnold explains that the fighters head over the ocean because NORAD is “looking outward” and has to have clearance to fly over land. [9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003] One of the Langley pilots, Craig Borgstrom, later says that after taking off, “They (NEADS) [are] giving us the heading and altitude of north-northeast up to 20,000 feet. Then shortly after takeoff they changed our heading more north-westerly and gave us max-subsonic. That’s as fast as you can go without breaking the sound barrier.” Reportedly, the Langley fighters are now being vectored toward Washington, instead of New York. [Filson, 2004, pp. 63-65] Yet, in contrast to these accounts, the BBC reports that just before takeoff at 9:24 a.m., the pilots are specifically told that Flight 77 may have been hijacked, and they get a cockpit signal indicating they are in an emergency wartime situation (see (9:24 a.m.)). All the above accounts concur that, for whatever reason, the fighters go too far east. They don’t reach Washington until roughly around 10:00 a.m.\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission, NEADS contacts Washington flight control to ask about Flight 11. A manager there happens to mention, “We’re looking—we also lost American 77.” The commission claims, “This was the first notice to the military that American 77 was missing, and it had come by chance. ... No one at FAA Command Center or headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American 77.” [9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004] Yet, 38 minutes earlier, flight controllers determined Flight 77 was off course, out of radio contact, and had no transponder signal (see (8:56 a.m.)). They’d warned American Airlines headquarters within minutes. By some accounts, this is the first time NORAD is told about Flight 77, but other accounts have them warned around 9:25 a.m.\nColin Scoggins at Boston flight control calls NEADS to report a low-flying airliner he has spotted six miles southeast of the White House. He can offer no details regarding its identity. The plane is reportedly Flight 77, but as it has its transponder turned off, no one realizes this at the time. The news of the plane “sets off a frenzy.” Major Kevin Nasypany orders Major James Fox, head of the NEADS Weapons Team, “Get your fighters there as soon as possible!” Staff Sergeant William Huckabone says, “Ma’am, we are going AFIO [emergency military control of the fighters] right now with Quit 2-5 [the Langley fighters]. They are going direct Washington.” [Vanity Fair, 8/1/2006] The Langley fighters will arrive over Washington some time around 10 a.m. (see (9:55-10:15 a.m.)).\nFrom the 9/11 Report...\nThere is conflicting evidence about when the Vice President arrived in the shelter conference room. We have concluded, from the available evidence, that the Vice President arrived in the room shortly before 10:00, perhaps at 9:58.\n15 references to \"Cheney\" in that little \"timeline\" I posted. Mostly having to do with what he knew, when he knew it, and at what time he arrived at the PEOC.\nOf course, the timeline ends at 9:37am. Dick Cheney didn't arrive at the PEOC for another 18 minutes. At least according to the 9/11 Report.\nWant to explain to me why this man deserves a \"free pass\" in regards to his actions on 9/11, and why he doesn't have to explain them publicly, or under oath?\ndidn't richard clarke and mineta both contradict Cheney's story?\nOne eyewitness account, David Bohrer, a White House photographer, says Cheney leaves for the PEOC just after 9:00 a.m.\nJon Gold on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 11:32am.\nHe seems the type who would be willing to take a leading role, knowing that people are probably more afraid of him than anyone else in Bushworld.

With Andrews AFB just 10 miles away? It's ludicrous. Insultingly ludicrous.\nAlso, how is it possible they \"lost\" track of 77's flight path? It's not.

Seeing a large jet fly low towards the pentago from the perspective of a restaurant is fine, but when all other angles and vantages are available, what could possibly be the reason for not allowing the big picture to be seen. As well, the pentagon still is not the center of all things suspicious and damning. Let's talk about demolition.\ngreenback (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 8:42pm.\nI know Alex Jones and others says that the Pentagon could be a 'honeypot', I don't think I agree like I usually do with him.\nI think if it was, it would of came out with the popularity of Loose Change and totally discredited the entire video (in the mainstream view).\nI'm 99% sure that this video will barely show what happened...why else would the FBI release it now?\n\nIf it does I hope people can see the CGI and how they spliced it.\nHere's the deal . . . Gone with the Wind didn't take this much time to produce and it was on celluloid and hand spliced. Most security cameras are time-domain multiplexed. At the NTSC frame rate of 30-frames-per-second, recording equipment divides the total cameras by this frame rate. For instance ten (10) camers, 1/30th of the time is dedicated or 3 frames per second. This is why most security cameras typically appear like a sequence of time-lapse still frames.\nNow, let's say we see a video that runs at the full frame rate. I'd have ask is it possible that the hotel had only one camera to one recording device, thus the full frame rate?\nI hope the truth \"is\" shown and this does not look like a hi-def full frame-rate production, again I'd really have questions if this be the case.\nIf I recall correctly, Tom Hanks shook hands with President Kennedy in the movie Forest Gump - we all know that looked pretty convincing - more developed technology today.

Thats a quality film camera photo, not a webcam or surveillance cam photo.\nAnd with a perspective as such it would be easy to superimpose a airliner in to the video since we all know a 767 is bigger than a skywarrior or global hawk. There is no way a 767 hit the pentagon. There are TWO engines, one hole.

You twoofers see what you want to see. If the video is low quality, you'll say it was a \"missile\". If it is high quality, you'll claim it was doctored. Your dopey theory isn't based on evidence, so facts are immaterial. You believe America attacked itself because you believe America is evil.\nRealWorld (not verified) on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 8:17pm.\n\"You believe America attacked itself because you believe America is evil,\" sounds like it came right out of Bill O'reilly's mouth on Fox News. This is the typical disinginuous twisting and misrepresenting of any and all criticisms anybody brings forth against the Bush Fascist Regime. Well, you may have memorized the right wing's talking points, but you have not offered any intelligent arguments to refute the \"twoofers\", whatever that means.\nFirst of all, we don't believe that, \"America attacked itself.\" That is the most assinine thing anybody could possibly say. No, we believe that the Bush Fascists attacked America. The Bush Fascist cabal is not America, they attacked America.\nSecond of all, we don't believe \"America is evil.\" That is yet the same assinine distortion of our position.

On the diagram below (courtesy of Google Maps) it is obvious that they could not have recorded the impact since it was around the corner of the building. But depending on their camera locations they may have been able to record the flight path from various angles since the aircraft would have essentially looped around the building.\"\nFerric Oxide (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 6:40pm.\nWhere is evidence of Flight 77 hitting pentagon?\nNormally I dismiss people who think F77 hit the pentagon as believers in the official story. Outside of the \"no-planers\" in regards to the WTC, there seems to be a breed of \"yes-planers\" in regards to Flight 77 hitting the pentagon, which breeds life within the 9/11 truth movement. Given the amount of evidence that F77 did not hit pentagon, such as, hole too small on pentagon wall (before outside wall collapse), and lack of significant debris, what evidence is there that points to F77 hitting Pentagon?\n911Truth (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 6:41pm.\nThe \"yes-planers\" at the Pentagon group are composed of either A: a small but vocal bunch of disinfo agents such as Jim Hoffman, John Judge, and Mark Robinowitz at oilempire.us. or B: people who are dupes of the above. The fact is that there is no evidence so support the OGCT (Official Government Conspiracy Theory) that fllight 77 hit the pentagon, so instead, the agents generally resort to PSYOP tactics, such as ridicule and attempts to discredit the messenger. \"The argument that flight 77 didn't hit the pentagon is a waste of time,\" for example.\nAll the physical evidence proves that flight 77 did not hit the Pentagon. Disinfo agents such as John Judge and Jim Hoffman never discuss this evidence. The \"yes-planers\" only point to eyewitness testimony, which does not hold as much weight as physical evidence, which any experienced investigator will tell you. Most of the eye-wittnesses are not credible, being that they are mostly military and msm employees. How did 10 USA Today employees wind up in the right place at the right time to \"witness\" flight 77 hitting the Pentagon? What are the odds of that being possible?\nhttp://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/nwsltr68e.html to take a look at the \"witnesses\" to see just who they really are.\nSerious Disinfo Here!!!!\nI am part of a 9/11 Truth group on the west coast. I know many people who have left the San Fransisco 9/11 group because people have told me the group is guided by Jim Hoffmans theory that Flight 77 hit the pentagon, and apparently the group does not tolerate anyone who thinks otherwise. People got disgusted with this practice, and many left to either form a new group or do individual research.\nIn regards to the group I am involved in, I have had a couple people attack me specifically on the Flight 77 issue, but not on any other issue. Folks, I'm sorry but there is some serious disinfo going on with the pentagon situation. Now we do not know what for sure what exactly hit the pentagon, but it should not be hard to figure out that there is plenty more evidence to show that F77 did not hit the pentagaon than there is evidence to show that it did. That's a no-brainer.\n911Truth (not verified) on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 12:36pm.\npassengers at the Pentagon! The enormous forces + the explosion & fire, would've certainly destroyed any DNA that had been present!\nSo if the airplane really hit the Pentagon, why did they then feel the need to fabricate DNA results???\nJon Gold shows his true Aaaaaaagent colors...\nI always had my suspicions about Jon Gold, but his comments in this discussion thread really confirmed it for me. For one thing, the fact that Jon Gold uses known liar John Judge to reference his support of the official government fiction that flight 77 hit the Pentagon is kind of a dead giveaway. Besides John Judge's ridiculous fairy tale about the amazing and mysterious AA flight attendent/fellow conspiracy researcher/friend/rescue worker/expert plane parts identifier who \"proved\" that flight 77 hit the Pentagon, John Judge has also been busy inventing ridiculous fairy tales to support the official government fiction that the plane crashes and ensuing fires is what brought down the 3 WTC towers...\nYES, IN CASE ANYBODY MISSED IT, JOHN JUDGE REJECTS THE CONTROLLED DEMOLITION THEORY OF THE 3 WTC TOWERS - EVEN BUILDING 7! Why on earth would Jon Gold risk his reputation by siding with such a professional liar?\nSecond of all, Jon Gold uses typical PSYOP type arguments - attacking the messenger rather than talking about the evidence that the messenger is presenting. His one line comment above is the typical example. When a PSYOP agent has no valid arguments against the evidence that contradicts an official government lie (such as regarding the Pentagon attack), they resort to BADJACKETING - which is to accuse the messenger of being an agent in front of other people in the movement. BADJACKETING has long been the favorite tactic of COINTELPRO for the purposes of attempting to discredit someone in the movement in the eyes of other people in the movement.\nSo when Jon Gold responds to someone's argument by saying only, \"you're an agent\" without offering any valid reasons, and without offeriing any counter-evidence, he is just showing his true colors. It gets tiresome when he does this over and over again.\nYou're saying John gets paid to lie? Ever see his car?\nJon Gold on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 10:33pm.\nWhat does his car prove?\nSo, Jon, how could you possibly support someone like John Judge when he even lies about he collapse of the WTC towers? You really need to address this. Talking about John's car is just smoke and mirrors to distract us away from the uncomfortable fact that by referencing and supporting a known liar, your credibility comes into question.\nThe only thing I have to address are envelopes. He lies, or he has a difference of opinion? Or are you forgetting that according to the Scripps Howard poll, only \"16 percent of Americans speculate that secretly planted explosives, not burning passenger jets, were the real reason the massive twin towers of the World Trade Center collapsed?\"\nHe is in the remaining 84% that don't believe the buildings were brought down by Controlled Demolition, however, I have spoken to him on several ocassions, and he most certainly believes elements of our Government were complicit in the attacks.\nI have a good relationship with Professor Jones, and Dr. Griffin. I have posted all of their information. I have promoted every single movie that has come out with regard to Controlled Demolition.\nConsidering all that I've sacrificed, and all that I've done for this movement, my \"credibility\" should only be doubted by those who seek to destroy it.\nThe fact that I even have people trying to destroy it tells me that I must be doing something right.\nJon Gold on Sat, 11/04/2006 - 12:02am.\nJohn Judge does not simply \"believe\" with the 84% of the population who haven't looked into the evidence of controlled demolition. Rather, John presents himself as a researcher on 9/11. He HAS looked into the evidence, but he does not address it. Instead, he manufactures absurd and quite elaborate fabrications to uphold the official gov't fiction of how the buildings collapsed. For example, he said that building 7 was structurally damaged by 1.5 richter quakes that occured when the planes hit the twin towers. Obviously, anybody with, like, an IQ higher than 80 would not believe such nonsense and we know that John's IQ is higher than 80. He tells lie after lie - such as claiming that the bottom 10 stories of building 7 was somehow cut out 1/3 into the building - a blatent lie. If that were true, several central columns would have been cut out, which we know did not happen. John fabricates this without offering a shred of evidence. Besides, he knows damn well that even if that were true, building 7 would not have fallen symmetrically within its own footprint in less than 7 seconds. This list of absurd lies that John fabricates to support the official collapse theory is endless and there is no way that an experienced researcher like John could possibly believe such nonsense that he spews.  He is very clever. Again, it is not about disagreement, John goes out of his way to lie and fabricate elaborate fictions to add to the official story, then he goes out of his way to disparage good 9/11 researchers who have proven that controlled demolition was used. That is the obvious behavior of PSYOPS agents.\nAnd don't forget Judge's ridiculous fable about his friend/fellow JFK conspiracy researcher/AA flight attendent/rescue worker/high-clearence Pentagon volunteer/expert plane parts identifier story that becomes more absurd and outrageous with every new version he tales. Yet again, John Judge does not address the physical evidence but can only see fit to fabricate elaborate and clever nonsense to support the official government story, like a true PSYOPS agent.\n\"I have spoken to him on several ocassions, and he most certainly believes elements of our Government were complicit in the attacks.\"\nWell obviously, he has to say that! That's how it works. How else can someone infiltrate the 9/11 movement in order to poisen and attempt to confuse and divide the movement? By saying that it was NOT an inside job? It's a no brainer that any disinfo agent has to at least pretend to be a 9/11 truther.\n\"I have a good relationship with Professor Jones, and Dr. Griffin\"\nThen why to you attack and ridicule them and everybody else who does not accept the Boeing at the Pentagon official fiction? The overwhelming consensus among the credible 9/11 researchers, including the Schollars for 9/11 Truth, Barrie Zwicker, Webster Tarpley, SPINE (Scientific Panel Investigating Nine Eleven), Jim Marrs, etc., is that the physical evidence scientifically disproves that flight 77 could have hit the Pentagon, and they have published their research to back it up. Who does that leave? Lets's see...only Jim Hoffman. And Jim Hoffman has not published anything to support his position that flight 77 hit the Pentagon, he only engages in PSYOP-type arguments basically ridiculing and attacking everybody else. That is why Hoffman hasn't been invited to any recent 9/11 conferences. People are tired of his divisive and destructive behavior towards other good 9/11 researchers.\n\n\nSorry, but if I have to choose between Dr. Griffin, Professor Jones, Jim Fetzer, Kevin Barret, most of Schollars of 9/11 Truth, SPINE, Barrie Zwicker, Webster Tarpley, Jim Marrs, etc., on one side, and a tiny clique consisting of Jon Gold, Jim Hoffman, John Judge on the other, common sense forces me to go with the former.  If you act like a PSYOP agent, then you have to expect that people will see you as one.\nKeenan on Sat, 11/04/2006 - 1:33am.\nWhen I do, you'll be the first one I tell.\nIncidentally, are you sure you're not thinking of Nico Haupt?\nTell me why the stats suggest that my posts are the most popular on this site. \nNice try, but everybody can see that you still refuse to address my points, and those of all the good 9/11 researchers that you attack with your Pentagon disinfo nonsense. Playing popularity contest is just more smoke and mirrors. All you can do is respond in typical PSYOPS fashion, yet again...still waiting for you to address my points...\nYou are simply proving over and over again that you do not have any valid arguments.\nI have never...\n\"Attacked\" any of the individuals you cited, and I am friends with several of them.\nAs far as my \"Pentagon disinfo nonsense\", you mean this, or this?\nIt's interesting that your first posts on this site are to attack me.\nDid Nico send you?\nI'm off to take part in some 9/11 Truth activism.\nWhen's the last time you did the same?\nYou have consistently attacked anybody on this forum who does not accept the official government fiction of flight 77 hitting the Pentagon. You typically use arguments such as, \"the no Boeing at the Pentagon theorists are disinfo agents\", or \"arguing that flight 77 didn't hit the Pentagon is a waste of time\". By implication, you are therefore attacking all the good 9/11 researchers who do not accept the official myth of flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, including your friends Professor Jones, David Griffin, Kevin Barret, James Fetzer and most of the Schollars for 9/11 Truth, Webster Tarpey, Barrie Zwicker, Jim Marrs, Dylan Avery, Jasen Bermes and the folks at Louder than Words, SPINE, Dave Von Kleist, Eric Hufschmid, etc., and all the folks on this forum who also question the official myth of the Pentagon attack.\n\"I'm off to take part in some 9/11 Truth activism.\nWhen's the last time you did the same?\"\nYet again, more smoke and mirros to deflect attention away from the issue you still refuse to address, which is why are you trying to destroy so many good researchers in the 9/11 movement with your Pentagon disinfo crap?\nAt this point, I realize that you are not going to address the real issue because you don't have any valid arguments to dispute what all the above-named researchers have put on the table, all you can do is attack. Therefore, I'm not going to waste any more time with you. You have been exposed for all to see what your true purposes are.\nKeenan on Sat, 11/04/2006 - 12:56pm.\nThat giving advice to individuals, based on my experience, to focus on different aspects of the Pentagon, is \"attacking\" them? As far as calling people \"disinfo\", there ARE \"disinformationists\" out there. Some have frequented this site. I know for a fact that I'm not one of them.\nIn regards to John Judge, I created this thread to try and find out why people don't like him. I have always found him to be a tremendous resource. He is a walking encyclopedia of information, and anyone who's been around a long time knows that. I thought it would be interesting to get his perspective on different issues.\nJust as I would like to hear what Michael Parenti has to say. Just as I would like to hear what Gore Vidal has to say. Just as I would like to hear what Ray McGovern has to say.\nJust because you have a difference of opinion about a certain aspect of 9/11, doesn't mean you have to be bitter enemies. There are individuals out there who try to make it this way, but that's not how it's supposed to be. To me, as long as you make an honest effort at getting people involved, without hurting the movement, then you're fine by me.\nFeel free to ask Prof. Jones, David Griffin, Kevin Barrett, Dylan Avery, Jason Bermas if they think I've ever \"attacked\" them. Jim Fetzer and I have had a few disagreements. Barrie Zwicker and I have only corresponded a few times. I don't know Jim Marrs, the people at SPINE, or Dave Von Kleist. Eric Hufschmid and I used to be friends. We aren't any more.\nTell me... Have I ever been an individual with a history of causing disruption within this movement? An individual who starts email campaigns directed against certain individuals in this movement? An individual who writes denouncing articles against certain organizations within this movement? An individual who writes denouncing articles about certain events that take place within this movement? An individual who keeps tabs on what certain individuals within this movement are saying so that he can use their statements against them in the future? An individual who makes sure to act like a lunatic when the mainstream media decides to give this movement some attention? An individual who takes it upon himself to \"investigate\" certain individuals within this movement in the hopes of discrediting them?\nThe answer to that long list of questions is no.\nSome people have. Do you condone that kind of behavior?\nAlso, tell me why you think it's ok to promote a missile or an A-3 Sky Warrior hitting the Pentagon on National Television where all a pundit has to do to make you look like a fool is ask, \"Then where are the passengers?\"\nI don't like the fact that they have the ability to do that. Therefore, I try to ask that different aspects are promoted.\nJon Gold on Sat, 11/04/2006 - 10:57pm.\nvirtually every single eyewitness who claimed to see Flight 77 hit the Pentagon either worked for USA Today(they have been connected for years to the agency. but dont ask me, just google USA Today-CIA connections) or the government. im just saying............\nWho told me their grandparents live in a building within view of the Pentagon, and that they saw an explosion but no plane. Granted, they are old folk, but there it is. Add my eyewitnesses to the pile of contradictory ones, fwiw!\nthis is the problem with the 9/11 truth movement, there are so many diverse theories, i'm not nocking anyone it's just when they release a video of a plane clearly hitting the pentagon it could have a profound effect on the truth movvment.\nAnders (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 6:42pm.\ndoesn't make sense (as i type this post) to release it after the election. makes you wonder what's up.\nwhat is the reason this couldn't just be released with the Citgo video? granted I don't know all the red tape procedural stuff that comes with something like this, but they're both security videos from private businesses, why is this one taking longer to reach us? i'm not suggesting something untoward, but it just really doesn't make much sense.\nto get it JUST RIGHT.\nilluminating9_11 (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 8:00pm.\nI think they had time and this is more of an election thing. watch them pretend that whatever they release \"puts the conspiracy theories to rest.\"\nyep, the truth movement is ïn its last throes.\" we can only hope, given what that phrase seems to mean in Iraq!!\nwhatever it shows it won't reveal any objective truth on the matter.\nThe FBI or whoever has had it all this time and can make it show whatever. Most likely it won't have been manipulated, it will simply show an ambiguous object hitting the pentagon, or only the explosion and smoke will be visible. If that plane does show up on the video it will consist of perhaps 8 pixels to argue about what it was or wasn't, or what it's trajectory is or is not. The fact that the pentagon issue cannot be precisely determined (like the rest of 9/11) only indicates it's most likely total BS. I agree with Jim Fetzer and the whole mindset that if anything on that day happened how the OTC claims it should be fairly obvious. Every day that goes by leaving these matters which should be scientifically verifiable to a matter of faith, only further cements my knowledge that this whole thing is a lie. I mean comeon people, at this point, how much more obvious can it get? The sheer amount of time these questions and contradictions have hung in the air without being resolved is a proof itself. The air is thick with stale lies and it's really starting to stink to where more and more people are noticing.\nUntil some kind of real investigation takes place nothing can really be verified. And these things (false flag operations) are set up in such a way to leave evidence appearing one way when the opposite is true. I sure hope we're not still talking about evidence about what did and didn't happen 5 more years from now. And who knows the kind of myth and folklore and further divide 9/11 will come to represent 10 and 15 more years from now. Will it pass to become another JFK? An event rife with contradiction and speculation, where most of the public knows it's BS, and yet the government will always stick to it's own history, a history that it wrote?\nResearcher488 (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 6:59pm.\n\"please note that we still have a second FOIA request active for the other 84 flight 77 recordings. we WILL get those as well. they should include the citgo tape and the doubletree hotel tape (there's no sheraton hotel tape, BTW)\"\nhave nothing to say about this upcoming release?\nwhen the gas station tape came out...\nWhere did the number 84 come from (in terms of pentagon attack videos out there)?\nscreaminaj (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 8:01pm.\n\"September 9, 2005: Special Agent Jacqueline Maguire of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division files a DECLARATION describing her search for records responsive to Bingham's FOIA request.

But this model only went to show how unlikely it all is - almost like the \"magic bullet theory\" of JFK, nothing is really \"impossible\".\nSadly, i assume the video will once again be like the gas station video, something that shows almost nothing. And even if a plane is seen on it, remember the official version had a military C130 flying behind the 757 and the pilot seeing it crash (the same magic C130 that appeared in Shanksville later).\nGreg (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 8:43pm.\nhappen to push the envelope a little bit??? It's getting sort of annoying.\nAre you talking about the up/down arrows?\nOr the stars that go with the blog posts?\nI find the up/down arrows helpful in that I sometimes just want to note that I agree, or that the post was a good one without adding a post that says next to nothing -- like \"Good post!\" Also, there are certainly times when I want to express disagreement without contributing to a thread. I don't think I have an ax to grind, though some may disagree.\nGiven that only registered users can vote on posts, what would make you think a really dumb one would get a lot? Ten votes in either direction happens pretty infrequently -- which means most people don't vote, most of the time.\ncasseia on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 1:26am.\nand the site owners should be able to detect abuse... normally I think they tell us a lot about how strongloy people feel how about which issues.\nhaha, democracy in action man. the people have spoken by giving casseia 5 and you -5. dont take it personally, ive gotten my share of negative posts before myself. i like the point system because it saves me from going on rants or getting in arguments. i can just give somebody a negative point and move on if i dont feel like getting into it. my 2 cents.\nsure, i think its consistent. you got a -7 on your post because obviously more people here like the points system than dont like it. thats why casseias post got almost the mirror opposite in positive points. same thing with the Jon Gold-Keenan exchange. i would guess that more people on this site(at least people who voted) think that its more likely Flight 77 didnt hit the Pentagon than did. and Jon may be popular with many people here, but there are some who dont appreciate how he and others like John A. compare the no Flight 77 theory with CGI and holograms and make little snide remarks about how speculating about Flight 77 \"hurts the movement\" and causes the media to slander and ridicule as, as if they wouldnt do that anyway. both Jons do great work, but they likely lose some points by ridiculing CD and Pentagon theories regularly. just a guess. and for the record Andrew, i typically dont give your posts thumbs down, in fact, the one you have negative 7 on right now i only clicked down becuase im one of the ones who likes the point system. i typically agree with what you say, and agree that you have the right to talk about CGI or anything else. recently when there was discussion about banning no-planers i voiced my opinion that we should not, despite being very much against that theory. so basically, i think the point system is useful.\nwhich quotes were you referring too? I only give minus to anyone who agrees with the official story or says it wasn't an inside job because I'm 100% confirmed that it was. And I was a supporter of Bush and the war for a few years!\ncard51short on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 10:35pm.\nThe article stresses the point that the employees watched them multiple times - who were the employees and what do they say they saw?\nTrollosaurus (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 8:00pm.\neffects in the manipulated video are real, and that they did see the same thing themselves.\nhave any credibility whatsoever?\nAny CG enthusiasts?\nSomeone needs to bring out a couple of CG examples of similar things to show how easy it is to fake these things, before the Officials do the same thing.\nPreempt this stuff, guys.\nPreempt this stuff, guys. Just say that clear video is coming out in the next week of the Pnetagon hit. If it is anything less, alternative theorists look good.\nTed Lover. (not verified) on Thu, 11/02/2006 - 11:47pm.\nAccording to Special Agent Jacqueline Maguire of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, the Doubletree Hotel videotape \"did not show the impact of Flight 77.\"\nIf what they release on the 9th (Doubletree Hotel video) shows flight 77 impacting the Pentagon, we know it's lie (according to what the FBI has already admitted).\nstallion4 on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 12:02am.\ngreat post stallion! Either way, they are liars!\nBut I already know that it won't be anything significant.\ncard51short on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 12:40am.\nI hope ithe video has a good view of the object that hit the pentagon. Hopefully this will show what it was and put an end to this chapter in the 9/11 book. The other recently released footage didnt show jack. I still think it was a jet airliner but until we see some good footage its technically an unidentified flying object. My vote goes to commercial airplane.\nAndy White on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 2:05am.\nOf course, just for the sake of posibilities, what if the new tapes show something other than flight 77.\nTruth for a Change on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 4:00am.\nI'm pretty sure that's the only option completely outside the realm of possibility at this point. If there was anything at all on that tape that could in any way damage the official conspiracy theory, the Feds just would have lost the tape, burnt it by accident or shredded it and thrown it away (in several trash cans in several locations, preferably). If you haven't noticed, evidence has been blatantly destroyed throughout this painful process, in plain sight of anyone who cares to look.\nI'm with the guy who said we'll at most see a few distorted pixels of somethingness and the explosion. And the Hannitys and O'reillys of this world will feel totally vindicated. Og, it must feel good being them, or suffering from the same illness... Ignorance must truly be bliss.\nGisli (not verified) on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 4:24am.\nWhy be afraid of Pentagon NPT?\nEven if they released a sophisticated piece of CG imagery, there'd still be the fact that the entry hole is way too small and the \"exit hole\" is way too big and way too far in (10ft of reinforced concrete, I mean WTF). Matter of fact is that the physical evidence does not match the official narrative. And thus, there's nothing wrong with calling the Pentagon issue to everyone's attention...it's a truly big stinking fish, and no amount of special fx high gloss envelope will ever change that. Unless we'll all be lobotomized, of course.\nSo in short, don't fear the Pentagon NPT, the facts speak for themselves. If someone had an inkling that the PTB might release footage of a hellish inferno engulfing WTC7's south face, would you stop bringing its controlled demolition up?\nbruce away from home (not verified) on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 5:36am.\ndoes nobody else even consider that this will be a really good film....if i was them i woulda kidnapped the best techy in hollywood and forced him to sit in chair until he produces a fake video capable of convincing the unconvinced! dont underestimate their intelligence and deviousness.\nThe chief suspect holds all the \"evidence\" and gets to release bits and pieces of said \"evidence\" a politically opportune times, if at all. The Ben Laden tapes strongly appear to have been faked and the cell phone calls from the planes also appear to be faked. Why would any released photos be accepted as unaltered true and correct photos?\nEven when and if we see photo of a \"plane\" hitting the Pentagon, we still do not know what it was that \"hit\" the Pentagon, much less if the photo is faked.\nThe chief suspect(s) are murderous treasonous despots and evil thugs.\nThis story is much ado about nothing.\nOur opinions and positions on so many issues are so similar - actually identical - that people are going to begin to wonder why they have never seen us in the same room together.\nYour analysis of the Pentagon brew-ha-ha is quite lucid.\nJohn Albanese on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 9:59am.\nWe must share the same brain.\nAbby Scott thought I was you.\nKarl Rove promised something spectacular for October, but it makes better sense to wait until Monday...however the computer technology available today can make anything look any way you want it to. My guess is, it'll be a doctored fake. Good, but faked.\nThat still won't explain the perfectly round cirlcle of impact though.\nMaybe it wil show...\n...Hani Hanjour waving to the camera as the plane passes by....\nMy guess is that the explosion will obscure the impact.... there will not be full penetration prior to an explosion.\nI think that we were given a hint though.... the FOIA request mentions the videos showing an impact with the Pentagon..... the person reviewing the videos said that there were only so many videos showing that.... perhaps we simply need to request the videos showing a plane flying over the pentagon.\nJJames (not verified) on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 10:47am.\nIt will either be something totally unhelpful like the Citgo tape, just so people can say they're not hiding anything (except all the PENTAGON surveillance camera tapes) or a decent fake to \"put it all to rest\" except of course for the LIHOPPERS who will harp on about warnings and missed chances to kill bin Laden, yatta yatta.\nOf course thanks to Nico we'll have to choose a term other than \"video fakery\" to describe what they did. Video forgery might be a good alternative. It's almost like the NPT folks were setting us up for something like this, no?\nIn any case, just goes to show how important the demolitions are compared to the Pentagon. Larry Silverstein didn't sign the lease on the Pentagon 6 weeks before 9/11, after all!\ndz on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 11:48am.\nLucky for you I have a sense of humor. It's true though... John and I say a lot of the same things. Let's say for instance that there are 9/11 Truthers who tend to focus on things of a scientific nature. As inconceivable as that is... :P John and I lean more towards the other side of the spectrum. People's actions, contradicting statements, historical references, and stuff like that. I also think that he and I probably had a lot of the same influences.\nProbably is lucky for me....\n.....as I recall, someone I know who has met you said you were a pretty big guy...\nSeriously, I'm a big fan of what you and John do here....just having a wee bit of fun....\nI agree that the science can be over-emphasized....as Donald Sutherland's \"Mr. X\" in the movie JFK says (to paraphrase), what's really important is \"why\" (why 9/11)?.......\naltruist on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 7:21pm.\nThe \"debunkers\" like to make fun of my 'weight problem.\" I can't \"weight\" to eat.\nThe actions of this Government after the fact point to why.\nPentagon Video in the Nick of Time for Midterms?\nIf I was a betting man, I’d bet the farm on it.\nHowever, simply releasing a five plus year old video with a predictable corporate media broadside taking “conspiracy nuts” to task, thus questioning their patriotism and even sanity, and suggesting Republicans were right all along about those cave-dwelling Muslims with their boxcutters, may not be enough to flip the election and keep the House and Senate in neocon hands.\nAs Killtown points out, “four days before the [2004] elections, the first video of bin Laden publicly taking credit for 9/11 which boosted Bush’s poll ratings in Ohio which lead to him being re-elected.” Indeed, after the video was aired, according to the Telegraph, Bush “opened a six-point lead over John Kerry…. If the trend is confirmed by other polls, Mr Bush may have his greatest enemy to thank for helping him secure another four years in the White House after the appearance of the video sparked a sharp final round of argument over which candidate can best defeat terrorism.” \nIt would seem, as well, the Osama in the “October Surprise” video had plastic surgery, specifically to make sure he did not resemble the real Osama, who died nearly three years before the fake Osama went before the camera. Compare the Osamas on this page and decide for yourself.\nA blurry security camera video shot from atop the Doubletree Hotel will be a shade better than the ludicrous video frames released in May, a pathetic effort lauded by the corporate media as a bold finale putting to rest once and all conspiracy theories about what hit the Pentagon. No doubt, as well, this latest effort, promised by the FBI and the suspicious Judicial Watch to be released no later than November 9th, will be heralded as conclusive evidence the aerobatic Hani Hanjour, who had trouble controlling and landing the Cessna 172, executed a flawless, 500 miles per hour maneuver of a Boeing 757 into the Pentagon.\nI think the elites WANT democrats to win this election.\nIt will make people think they have \"demanded change\", when democrats instead give us the status quo. The media will no doubt be falling all over telling the world how the \"people have spoken\" as the dems \"take back\" the house and/or senate.\nDemocrats winning will put lots of people back to sleep, thinking that they've \"done all they can\" and we'll just have to \"wait for congress to do something\".\nIn the next few weeks the phony left/right paradigm will be exploited in the media like you've never seen before. Then we will get nothing, not a peep, out of the democrats for the next two years and beyond!\nkevin (not verified) on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 11:27am.\nright on, that is exactly what is going on... they're switching the folks at the top on us is all. MAYBE they'll try to then use a little LIHOP to defuse the truth movement. SEE? democrats are INVESTIGATING 9/11 - the loonies will NEVER be satisfied though. with a few LIHOPPERS from the movement cheering on the Dems, who knows they may have some success... but I doubt it. it may help them contain the truth for a little while longer until the 2008 october surprise, right befor McCain and... someone beat Hillary and Obama... or the other way around depending how things go. they think they cover all the bases--our job is to keep making new bases!!\nThere is no 2-party system in this country any longer!\nIt's a 1-party system, just the way the elites want it! No checks & balances!\nCould you ever image two leading Democrats, Kerry & Hillary, acting like such jellyfish in dire times like these? They should be ripping the Bushies to shreds, but there's hardly a peep out of them!\nGREEN PARTY candidates must start winning elections.\nDemocrats need to abandon this worthless spineless party and start supporting REAL candidates that stand for change.\nNunyabiz on Sat, 11/04/2006 - 1:13pm.\nThere are only two things related to the Pentagon on 9/11 that have potential for the 9/11 Truth Movement, and videos being released by the FBI ain't one of them. There is absolutely no way the government will ever release a video that shows a missile impacting the Pentagon on 9/11, so all speculation about these FOIA requests is pointless.\nTwo things are relevant: (1) What happened to the $2.6 trillion? (2) What were Cheney's \"orders\" as he watched a plane approach the Pentagon?\nThe No-Boeing theory will remain unproved.\nUm, how can the No-Being theory remain unproved when it was never unproved? The scientific evidence proves the No-Boing theory and you cannot dispute it, regardless of the \"eye-witness\" statements, most of whom are not credible, and much of it is contradictory anyway. The science of the physical evidence outweighs any eyewitness testimony - Just ask any experienced investigator. On top of that, you have the official lies and cover-up behavior (hiding the videos for example) - itself strong evidence that the government's version of what happened at the Pentagon is not true.\nThere really is no reasonable argument to support the government's fable that flight 77 hit the Pentagon theory. When you have both A: Physical evidence contradicting the official story and, B: Massive cover-up behavior, it's pretty much an open and shut case for any experienced investigator to conclude that the No-Boeing theory is the only reasonable one.\nAnyone who argues that the \"No-Boing\" theory is unscientific either has not done their homework, or has been duped by the small but loud clique of \"yes-planers\" such as John Judge, Jim Hoffman, or Mark Robinowitz, who's arguments pretty much consist of ridiculing those who do not accept the official Pentagon fable and accusing them of being disinfo agents.\nI happen to agree with Jim Hoffman. The No Boeing theory is full of holes, if you will, and represents a huge \"honey pot\" for skeptics.\nYou didn't provide any counter arguments. Just saying that the No Boeing theory is full of holes without providing any specifics is an argument which is full of holes itself. You are just behaving like a dupe of disinfo agents such as Jim Hoffman. The physical evidence scientifically proves that a Boeing dit NOT hit the Pentagon and you can not dispute it scientifically, just as you can not dispute the scientific evidence of controlled demolition at the wtc. \nKeenan on Sat, 11/04/2006 - 3:02pm.\nNo counter arguments? I linked to Jom Hoffman's essay chock full of counter arguments. The fact that you call Hoffman a \"disinfo agent\" does not make him so. He provides several photos of airplane parts on the Pentagon lawn (unlike Loose Change, which pretends there is only one such photo), and photos of parts inside the Pentagon. Reading fuzzy photos of the Pentagon is not \"scientific evidence\".\nYou mention controlled demolition of WTC, but I never said anything about the WTC. I do believe explosives were used at the WTC. I don't believe a missile hit the Pentagon.\nIt's weak arguments like the No Boeing stuff that continue to undermine this movement. Everytime the Loose Change people are on TV, the first question they are asked has to do with their theories concerning the Pentagon. Why do you think this is so? Because they make dubious claims about the Pentagon, and because No Boeing is a honey pot that will eventually be used to discredit everything 911 truth has done.\nThe better questions to ask about the pentagon are, how did anything hit the pentagon? and what did cheney order as a plane approached the pentagon? these questions lead to real evidence, not fuzzy photos.\nIn five years since 911 the gov't has had plenty of time to create whatever sort of fake footage they would like.\nWhatever the video contains will have no bearing on what actually happened to the Pentagon.\nA2planet (not verified) on Fri, 11/03/2006 - 7:07pm.\nthat it is \"possible\" that a Boeing 757 hit the Pentagon, virtually all of what little evidence there is shows that one DID NOT.\nI have to pretty much agree with \"most\" of the 9/11 researchers, at this point I would have to say the odds of \"something\" other than Flt 77 hitting the Pentagon are at least 90%.\nThere is a slight chance that a miracle was preformed and Hanjour top gunned his way to hit the Pentagon perfectly or that it was remote controlled and some how managed to fly 20' off the ground at 500mph and \"flow\" into a 16' hole while the Government kept a video tape clearly showing it -hidden for 5 years, but dont sound to feasible to me.\n"}

In some places, they’re even more common. Over the millennia of human history, people have developed plenty of ways to have fun with icy conditions. Some of these activities have evolved into competitive events played all over the globe. Here are some of the ice sports with the longest histories.\nSleds and sledges have been used since ancient times, particularly in areas with heavy snow cover. Today, there are three main competitive sledding sports: bobsled, luge, and skeleton, which are all derived from the same situation.\nIn the Swiss spa town of St. Moritz, hotelier Caspar Badrutt frequently hosted English tourists. In the 1870’s, guests at Badrutt’s hotel started using delivery sleds to race down hills and roads in St. Moritz. Sledders frequently interfered or collided with pedestrians, which, coupled with the roads’ many twists and turns, required a means of steering the sleds. This led to two developments: First, Badrutt built an ice track designed for recreational sledding. Second, Badrutt’s guests invented the three modern competitive sleds.\nBobsleds (or bobsleighs) are steered with two metal rings attached to a pulley system that turns the front runners. At the high speeds of competitive bobsleigh, turns must be subtle to prevent crashing. Passengers sit. At one time, five or six people would be on a bobsled crew, but in the 1930’s, the crew size was reduced to two or four people. In a two-person team, a pilot steers and a brakeman pulls the brake lever at the end of the race. A four-person team also has a pilot and brakeman, but adds two pushers.\nLuges are manned by one or two people. Lugers lie on the sled feet-first and steer by applying pressure to the runners with their calves or shoulders. The first record of the worbobsled oldd’s use is from 1905, from a Swiss dialect of French in which “luge” referred to a “small coasting sled.” The gloves worn for luge racing have tiny spikes built into the fingertips, allowing for maximum speed gain at at the start.\nSkeleton sleds are named for their simple, bare appearance. There are no steering or braking mechanisms; riders steer only by shifting their body weight and usually brake with their boots.  Top skeleton riders can reach speeds upwards of 75/mph.\nSometimes referred to as “chess on ice”, curling is played by two teams of four players each. The length of ice used for play is called a curling sheet, marked with a circular target area (or “house”) at each end. Players take turns sliding round stones of polished granite to the opposite house. Two sweepers use brooms on the ice to direct the stone’s path. When each team has thrown all eight of their stones, an end concludes, and points are counted according to the stones closest to the center of each house. Most games have eight or ten ends, this is why people go crazy in order to play now.\nCurling was invented in medieval Scotland, and today the World Curling Federation has its headquarters in Scotland. Curling existed at least as early as 1511, based on the year’s inscription on a curling stone found in a drained pond in Dunblane. The first reference in writing appears in a document from 1541, but the word “curling” was not used to describe it in print until a 1620 poem by Henry Adamson. The word refers to the motion of the stone across the ice.\nIn the early days of curling, stones were not uniform. Players used flat-bottomed river stones of varying size and shape, contributing to poor control after a throw. This is a contrast to modern curling, in which sweepers can direct the stones and do so deliberately. Other regions tried to solve the inconsistency with wood, irons, or tins filled with ice.\nCurling has been on the world stage since 1959, when the first world championship was held in Scotland. Only men were allowed to participate in the first Scotch Cup. Demonstration matches were held at the Olympic Games in 1924, 1932, 1988, and 1992, but curling was not an official Olympic sport until 1998. It remains so today, with separate tournaments for men and women.\nLike sleds, ice skates have been around for a long stretch of human history. The oldest evidence comes from a pair made of animal bone found at Lake Moss, Switzerland. These skates are dated to 3000 B.C. The earliest known reference in writing is from the 12th century, which also describes edgeless skates made of bone. The Dutch invented the first steel-edged ice skates in either the 13th or 14th century, and a height-to-width ratio for blades was established shortly afterward. The original Dutch designs have been only minimally altered in the centuries since their invention.\nThe first ice skating association was the Edinburgh Skating Club, formed in 1742. Contemporary writing suggests that the Club practiced an early form of figure skating, but figure skating didn’t become “official” until 1772. Robert Jones, an artillery lieutenant in the British military, wrote and published an instructional book on ice skating that went over basic forms. The publication of this book is seen as the point when skating split into figure skating and speed skating.\nCredit for the invention of modern figure skating goes to an American, Jackson Haines. In 1864, he won a skating championship by being the first skater to use dance and ballet in his movements, rather than following the British method of tracing patterns on the ice. He invented the sit spin skating move and a blade with a shorter length and curve that made turns easier. Americans and Britons still preferred the British mode for some time, but Haines popularized his forms in Europe.\nVienna was particularly impressed, and the Vienna School developed his techniques, eventually forming the International Skating Union in 1892, seven years after Haines’ death. As the world’s first international organization for ice skating, the Union codified rules for figure skating. It still exists today, though it has moved from its original home in the Netherlands to Lausanne, Switzerland.\nFigure skating first appeared at the Summer Olympics in 1908. It was the first winter sport to be held at the Olympic Games, 16 years prior to the first dedicated Winter Olympics.\nA variety of stick-and-ball games have existed for millennia, going back to before Christianity. In Europe, most of these games were not far removed from field hockey, such as Ireland’s hurling, Scotland’s shinty, and England’s “bandie ball” (now commonly called bandy). The Dutch and Norse played similar games on ice. But the first evidence of modern ice hockey comes from the 1700’s, when people in Britain would play “hockey on ice”. Rather than a ball, they would use a cork stopper from a barrel, called a “bung”. An engraving from 1797 shows someone ice skating on the River Thames with a stick and bung.\nWhen British soldiers and immigrants went to Canada and the United States, they brought their stick-and-ball games. They played “hockey on the ice” during cold weather. Informal games borrowed from Native American stick-and-ball games. In particular, a Mi’kmaq game similar to lacrosse lent physical aggression to informal games of hockey.\nThe first organized game of indoor hockey took place in Montreal on March 3, 1875. It was played between two teams of nine players. They used a circular, flat piece of wood rather than the more common bung or ball. The rules were derived from those used by England’s field hockey organization. The first hockey club was the McGill University Hockey Club, established in 1877, and team size went from nine to seven by 1880 (now hockey is played by six to a team, including the goalie). The first professional hockey players played for the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League by 1902.\nBecause both sports require ice skates, the history of speed skating is rather similar to that of figure skating. Skating clubs in Norway began holding organized races on ice skates in 1863, probably the first organized competitions. Tracks were not of standardized length until 1892, when the International Skating Union set the length at 400 meters. World championships used race distances of 500 meters, 1,500 meters, 5,000 meters, and 10,000 meters. Speed skating’s first Olympic feature was in 1924 at the first winter games.\nIn short track speed skating, four to six skaters start at the same time. They race in lanes around a rink with the same dimensions as an internationally-sized hockey rink. Long track speed skating is done in pairs on an oval ice track similar to an outdoor track course. The track has two lanes, and skaters switch lanes during their laps so they can cover the same distance.\nWhether for fun or glory, ice sports are a time-tested way to have fun in cold conditions. This list only accounts for some of them; if you’re at a loss, you can always fall back on the good ol’ snowball fight.\n"}

Thus creating a unique melting pot in which each culture tried to (and successfully did) preserve their identities in different regions, aspects and social levels throughout the country.\nWhat we do know is that although Capoeira has no written history until the 18th century, it definitely existed. This is most obviously portrayed by the art's oral history and tradition. Most, if not all, of the songs your teacher or Mestre know is from hearing the song from their teacher, friend and family etc, and so this goes hand in hand with other knowledge of the art.\nCapoeira has a huge oral tradition and this begins when the Portuguese first descended upon Africa to procure slaves through any means necessary. The Portuguese had already been to Brazil however. Seen as an excellent outpost for the Portuguese empire, it was close to Africa and India for convoys of trade. In 1500 they first set foot in Brazil and interacted and co-existed with the indigenous native tribes of Brazil, mainly the Tupi, and for 322 years Brazil was a Portuguese colony.\nThe Portuguese had massive plantations that they needed the natives to work on.\nAt first they purchased their slavery, exchanging all sorts of items but nothing of enough worth. Then they simply began forcing them to work with muskets and whips.\nEventually the Portuguese needed and wanted slaves from Africa, of which they already had hundreds of thousands in other parts of their empire for a century before they colonized Brazil. So it was a natural step for them to transport more captive Africans to Brazil. They came predominantly from Sudan, Guinea and Angola, though in those days borders were not so strict and there were slaves from Congo and Mozambique too. Tribes called Yoruba, Hausa and Bantu to name but a few. At first they enslaved only those whom they found got in their way, though it does not take long for power to corrupt and eventually slave trade was a business itself, human beings thought of as merchandise.\nInitially the cost of this was \"cheap\" and being greedy they over crowded the vessels which transported the slaves to Brazil. Which, back in the 16th century this was not an easy task, with terrible conditions for the slaves during a three month journey; they lost approximately 400,000 lives, bodies thrown away in to the deep Atlantic sea. With a high mortality rate of slaves in Brazil there were approximately 4,000,000 (four million!!!) slaves traded until 1850, when the Queiroz law abolished slavery. Though it continued illegally until 1888/89!\nThe slaves were always mixed, held in different plantations and senzalas (slave quarters) to familiar people (friends and family especially) and so making organized rebellions difficult. Nevertheless, as well as constant individual escapes, there were recorded revolts against their captivity and many times when they escaped they formed independent 'slave' villages in the jungles, forests and 'backlands', which were called Quilombos.\nThe slaves were not allowed any luxuries, especially the practice of fighting. There are many theories as to the actual birth of Capoeira, and there is no definite, finite birth or date where suddenly someone said this is Capoeira.\nIn 1890, the first Brazilian president Marechal Deodoro da Fonseca created the Código Penal, which contained an act that prohibited the practice of Capoeira nationwide, with severe punishment for those caught. Regardless of this it remained, practiced by the poorer population on public holidays, during work-free hours and similar occasions. Riots caused by police interference were common. The nick-names in Capoeira were predominant from the early days of the art but became more popular once Capoeira was officially illegal. This is something we keep today as a tradition.\nAnd so it was a bad time to be a Capoeirista.\nCapoeira even before this was often attributed to sneaky, violent criminals who were low- lives, sons of slaves etc... Much of the time Capoeira was played in like a death game, sometimes with razor blades between their toes when they fought or a hidden knife in their trousers, inviting a trend of silk scarves around the necks of Capoeiristas at rodas everywhere.\nAnd it wasn't just the razor blades, due to the quality of life and the association with Capoeira a lot of people were struggling just to survive day to day life, many carried knives and weapons which unfortunately came out in rodas too. Capoeira was never a popular art form (in fact it wasn't even known as one until the 30s/40s) and so when it became officially illegal many Capoeiristas turned to crime, of all sorts. Being self confident, with a fighting spirit and anger at the sudden 'freedom' many were given it was not a surprise that with nowhere to go and nothing to do they turned to crime.\nIt was also during this period that great Capoeiristas would rise up to fight off the persecution and repression of Capoeira. While the art had spread in this early period the police and government were cracking down so hard that it was all but extinguished in Rio and Recife. Recife had seen the Capoeira turn into a protection detail for the bands during Carnival and big events. A big band would march with a Capoeirista at the forefront and whenever another band was encountered there would be bloodshed. The Capoeira in Rio was simply more of a rogue/ criminal activity, in fact gangs had been formed that were so dangerous and powerful the government would use them to fend off rallies and unpopular group behaviour.\nBrazil was forcing Capoeira into a corner; one which it did not want to be in and for a while did not know how to get out of.\nCapoeira does not go away. No matter what the police did, who they killed, beat, tortured or corrupted it was always there, underneath the eyes of the authorities and people who didn't know what to look for. This period in time would turn out to be one of the most important periods in the already long saga of Capoeira.\nThere were legendary figures like Besouro, who had Corpo Fechado (closed body - a supposed magic of invulnerability) and Nascimento Grande who fought police when they had to and always came out on top.\nOnly 3 years prior to the start of the 1900s a momentous occasion happened for one young 8 year old name Vicente as he was invited by an African named Benedito to try Capoeira. Two years later Manuel Dos Reis Machado would be born into the world. It would be these figures that would go on to change the shape of the Capoeira world for ever...\nThese two legends (Mestre Pastinha & Mestre Bimba) were so integral to the twentieth century of Capoeira that even now all we do as Capoeiristas is in reverence to them, they are ancestors to us all and we pay homage and thanks for all that they did. They looked at the Capoeira and while one took it and repackaged it with great patience and skill the other sought to protect it, wrap it up with strength and intelligence to safeguard it for the future.\nIn this way, both Mestres's lifetimes of work coincided with each others, Mestre Bimba having ushered in a new wave of popularity with its legalisation and incorporation of athletic, martial aspects into Capoeira Regional. Mestre Pastinha knew that it would be wrong to lose the original style of Capoeira and so made his work in preserving every aspect and tradition of what would become Capoeira Angola.\nCapoeira had predominantly, in the eyes of many, gotten sloppy. Lacking discipline and organization, which would come soon enough, but not everyone would follow it but use its example. It is during this time that the police were becoming more intolerant of Capoeira due to the abolishment of slavery; they could no longer 'officially' treat some as lesser people and ignore their human rights.\nA rhythm for the Berimbau was also created in the early days of Capoeira; Cavalaria (Cavalry). The rhythm mimics the sound of mounted police, who were 9 times out of 10 the ones coming to arrest and punish the Capoeiristas having a roda or practising.\nTo this day our Mestres, professors and instructors like to play this rhythm to check our attention and also remind us of how lucky we are not to have to think that way anymore.\nIt is one of the most significant points in the History of Capoeira, the most significant in the History of Capoeira Regional and a massive point in the History of Brasil. It is 1930, in Salvador, Bahia, Mestre Bimba had cultivated his new style of Capoeira to a peak from which it would only climb higher and never look down. Mestre Bimba was invited to perform a demonstration of his Capoeira at the Governor of Bahia, Juracy Magalhães' palace. It was this demonstration that finally convinced the authorities of the value of this sacred art, culturally, historically and spiritually.\nCapoeira became 'legal' for the first time in the Country's history.\nFrom July 9th 1932 Mestre Bimba 'officially' opened his school CCFR - Centro de Cultura Fisica Regional, where his numerous students who were there at the birth of Capoeira Regional expanded ever onwards. To this day every single Capoeira Regional group can trace its origins back to Mestre Bimba himself through one or more of his students. His students remain some of the most brilliant (and famous) Capoeirista's to date: Mestre Decanio, Mestre Camisa Roxa, Mestre Acordeon, Mestre Itapoan, Mestre Onca Tigre (RIP) to name but a few.\nIn the '40s many Capoeiraistas began to move to Rio de Janeiro (and later Sao Paulo and so on), most of whom had trained with Mestre Bimba in Salvador, Bahia. Capoeira has now exploded across the world, in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australasia! With some groups teaching in nearly every continent, Capoeira has continuously grown throughout the world spreading the knowledge and love of this beautiful art.\nMestre Pastinha would be happy to know that although this growth came predominantly from Capoeira Regional, that (according to Nestor Capoeira) people began to take a great interest in Capoeira Angola in the '80s. People were flooding to the old masters, who fortunately were still around, to find out about this great traditional style of the art form, where they could learn more about the mandinga (magic/sorcery) and spirit of Capoeira.\nThe last of the styles, Capoeira Contemporanea, was created from the two already existing styles Capoeira Regional of Mestre Bimba and Capoeira Angola of Mestre Pastinha. One of the pioneers and founders of the new style was Mestre Arraia. It is an evolution of the two older styles; it is as much homage to the days gone by as it embraces the future. Today Capoeira is always around us, it has become a way of life for a lot of us.\nCapoeira groups today may have slightly different styles, names of songs, names of moves, graduation system and so on, but one thing we all share is the love and desire to spread our art to everyone we can.\n"}

The majority of students in the United States study Shakespeare in English classes throughout high school and the education surrounding Shakespeare curriculum is rooted in the linguistics and poetic form. His influence on English has survived centuries and his contribution to our vocabulary is often taken for granted. In Measure for Measure alone, we can thank Shakespeare for giving us the words “belongings,” “gnarled,” and “sanctimonious,” amongst a plethora of idioms and phrases. The intense study of Shakespeare’s English and the power of his words have fueled scholars and performers for centuries, keeping Shakespeare the most produced classic author.\nHowever, what happens when Shakespeare’s works are translated into other languages? Do the power of his words still retain their strength? In ArtsEmerson’s upcoming presentation of Measure for Measure, we invite audiences to hear Shakespeare’s words like you’ve never heard them before.\nFor Shakespeare especially, the universality of his work travels from culture to culture, language to language, without losing an ounce of substance. The stories remain intact, the emotions are still felt, and even those who cannot understand the words are able to understand the humanity. The human emotion Shakespeare is able to grasp is not bound by language. While his poetry is considered some of the most remarkable work we have, it possesses power beyond the page. How we communicate is often through unspoken means and Shakespeare, amongst his new words and famed phrases, allows for the breath for that very human connection on an emotional level.\nWe cherish his words, but perhaps Shakespeare’s ability to create connection is what keeps audiences entranced by the Bard’s folio. Shakespeare’s plays have been translated in over 80 languages, including Star Trek’s Klingon, making it remarkably clear that while he wrote in English, his plays resonate worldwide (and even into space apparently). With the upcoming production of Cheek by Jowl and Pushkin Theatre’s Measure for Measure, we invite audiences to engage with Shakespeare and perhaps experience something entirely new.\nCheek by Jowl and Pushkin Theatre’s Measure for Measure will be at the Emerson Cutler Majestic from OCT 24 -28.\n"}
