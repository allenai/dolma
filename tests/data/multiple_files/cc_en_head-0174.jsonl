Recently we spoke with Smith about the album, and about her passion for her profession.\nWhen and why did you develop a passion for music?\nWhen I first started learning the violin with Ninette Babineau and Pat Wyman in Halifax, I fell in love with the instrument. I just loved the sound! Later on I discovered string chamber music and was completely hooked - I remember listening to a recording of the Brahms viola quintets over and over again, thinking that it was the most amazing thing.\nI still love the violin as much (or more) than ever, and I also find teaching the violin very rewarding. I did my doctoral degree in violin performance with the American violinist Jorja Fleezanis, who is a huge proponent of new music (the John Adams violin concerto is dedicated to her and was premiered by her), and really discovered a love for new music in my studies with her.\nI’ve worked to try to take more risks musically and to try to create more colours and sounds, and to expand my range of expression.\nSometimes there are moments of self-doubt, but you just have to push through those!\nIt’s incredibly rewarding to perform and record great music, and to work with wonderful musicians.\nI’d like to think that I can create a beautiful sound on the violin, with a range of different colours that I can draw upon. It’s definitely exciting to try to find new sounds and new ways of playing something.\nI feel very lucky to have been part of recordings of the amazing music of Derek Charke (Live Wired and In Sonorous Falling Tones, which was nominated for an ECMA for Classical Recording of the Year in 2018) with Derek Charke, Mark Hopkins, Mark Adam, Jeff Hennessy, and others, and more recently to have been part of a recording of the wonderful chamber music of Carmen Braden, Songs of the Invisible Summer Stars, which was released in September 2019, with Mark Adam, Derek Charke, Suzanne Lemieux, and others.\nI really wanted to create a recording of music by Canadian women, and I was thrilled to have the opportunity to record phenomenal music for solo violin by the amazing composers Kati Agócs, Alice Ping Yee Ho, Veronika Krausas, Chantale Laplante, and Ana Sokolović.\nI was very lucky to work with Jeremy VanSlyke of Leaf Music, who produced the album. We recorded in the stone sanctuary of First Baptist Church Halifax, and it was wonderful to be able to make the recording in that beautiful space. I’m extremely grateful to FACTOR, the Government of Canada, and Canada’s private radio broadcasters for their support for Into the Stone.\nAlice Ping Yee Ho’s Caprice is a joyful, energetic work that really captures an emotion so vividly. It’s so much fun to play this piece!\nI’m grateful for the positive feedback I’ve received so far! One of the tracks from the album - Veronika Krausas’ piece Inside the Stone - was recently selected as a Spotify New Classical Release Pick, which was very exciting.\nPreparing to record the album definitely required some hard work, but at the same time I was striving to follow the composers’ directions in the music, which reveal their concept of the works, and to bring my own musical imagination to the process.\nWhat makes a good tune?\nA piece that really captures a mood or emotion; a strong rhythmic element can also be really compelling.\nWhat are your thoughts on Atlantic Canada’s music scene?\nI’m thrilled to be part of Atlantic Canada’s fabulous music scene and am so grateful for the wonderful collaborations and projects that I’ve been involved with here with such amazing musicians.\nI’m most grateful for FACTOR’s support for this album, and it’s wonderful that there are many organizations from both the government and the private sector that provide support for musical projects of various kinds. It could only be a good thing if there were even more of this kind of funding, which makes projects like this one possible.\nWhat do you have on tap for the rest of 2019 and going into 2020?\nAfter the Toronto show I am looking forward to performing some great repertoire for violin, clarinet, and piano, including the fabulous Bartók Contrasts and Stravinsky’s L’Histoire du Soldat, with the wonderful Eileen Walsh, clarinet, and Simon Docking, piano.\nGillian Smith will launch Into the Stone in Toronto at the Glenn Gould Studio on Saturday, October 5 with special guest Emily Rho, piano.\n"}

But you can apparently reduce the danger by purchasing Tesla Purple Free Energy Plates. Good to know.\n4) A note that only those who tithe exactly 10% (that’s before deductions, you sinner!), observe the Sabbath from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown (not Sunday, you heretics!), and use the King James Version of the Bible (drop that NIV and ESV, you reprobates!) will be saved. “Everyone else is under a curse and will be eliminated when Jesus Christ returns in the near future.” (One of the end-of-the-world article photocopies dates back to 1984, so I guess “near future” is a relative term).\n"}

One of these days winter will be over, but probably not soon enough!!!!\nWhen I was out in Santa Fe, N.M. a couple of weeks ago, I was able to spend a day walking around the downtown and shooting some photos! For me it’s always fun to get out and do this and it’s even more fun in a town like Santa Fe. The Southwest has a lot of great architecture and it’s just so different then what we see here in the Midwest! Lots of warm adobe tones and lots of turquoise colors really work well together and make for a lot of great photos!\nCathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi and is a statue of Kateri Tekakwitha. She is the first Indian of North America to be promoted a saint. The photo on the left is a statue at the Museum of Contemporary Native Arts called “Water Carrier”. The center photo is the inside of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. The last photo on the right is of the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe.\nIt’s time to get to work, so I hope that you have a wonderful week and thanks for checking out my work!!!!\nPhotography in Santa Fe, NM.\nCold Peoria Monday morning greetings to one and all!!!!\nI was out in Santa Fe last week doing a shoot for my friends at Modern Quilts Unlimited magazine! We were shooting on location in Santa Fe at the beautiful Las Palomas B&B and it made the perfect location for all these quilt shots that we did! We were able to shoot in a bunch of the different rooms there and it made for some very interesting backgrounds! Some of photos were also taken outdoors and we really lucked up because the evening after we finished shooting, Santa Fe got four inches of snow and that would have ruined any outdoor photography!!! Fortunately for us we were able to get the shots that we needed, so everything worked out great!\nHere’s one of my shots from Las Palomas and I think everyone is very happy with the shoot!!!!\nThanks as always for taking the time to check out my work and I hope that you have a great week to come!!!\n"}

What message are you projecting out to the world? Did you even think you were projecting a message?\nMaybe you are not consciously trying but by not trying to you are still sending a message.\nWho are you trying to notify? What information are you trying to present?\nIt’s all about presentation, how we present ourselves helps notify others about who we are. It helps them see what we believe and where we stand.\nIt’s a warning and a beacon. \nBut the bottom line is that we do it because we all just want to belong.\nIf you were a new visitor to our planet, you would see that we are all basically wearing costumes.\nYour clothes, your shoes, your hair or makeup, everything you are presenting on your body says something about you.\nYour costume identifies your tribe. Or in the case of Amazon Indians, your hair and your tattoos.\nThe motive here is to show other tribe members you belong to their tribe and at the same time show everyone else that you are not a member of theirs.\nOur costumes are really more about exclusion than inclusion.\nSometimes people are a little in your face in their efforts to emphasize that they are not a part of your tribe.\nBut it’s all just an effort to belong, especially in younger people. It’s almost a requirement. They need to break away from their parents, from the establishment, to show their independence.\nAnd that sometimes requires drastic action to make the right statement.\nThey use bright hair colors and drastic styles, tattoos, logo wear and clothes, piercings, etc. to make their point. They use shock and horror as a tool.\nI think we have all been there once upon a time. Maybe some of us were more drastic than others.\nI was 14 in 1964. I was in a band. I grew up at Lake Tahoe and hitchhiked to spend weekends in San Francisco in the Haight Ashbury district. What do you think I was doing? How do you think I looked?\nTalk about shock and horror. I freaked my family out!\nAt least for a minute but then my family is a bit eccentric. Take a look at my mother (Google \"Granny G\". She was a finalist on America's Got Talent.\nBut it’s just a period of transition, a transitioning out of one phase into another. Some phases take longer than others and some phases can become almost permanent. I’m sure you know people who are locked into a phase.\nDoes it matter? I don’t think so.\nBut think of all the tribes that you can immediately identify. You can see them everywhere, every day.\nFor example, look at biker clubs.\nI was at a rally the other day where my friend's band was playing (I was the roadie and part time singer) and there were about 5 or 6 biker clubs there. For me it was very interesting to see the hierarchy being displayed. With the tattoos, the bandannas, the leather, the patches, the prospects trying hard to belong, to earn their full patch. You can see the whole process of belonging in action.\nI have no problem with bikers, I get it. I like bikes. My best friend from childhood has been a Hell’s Angel since the sixties. He’s probably one of the few remaining Outlaws alive from the early days of the club.\nBut they’re tribes.\nLooking from the outside, although we may not really get how unique it is when several million kids throughout America are dressed the same way, we understand.\nWe can see how the need to be accepted by a group of like souls is so important.\nIt’s important to belong, to gain confidence and become more solid. To begin to become who you are.\nIt takes steps, phases and tribes.\nBecause it doesn't stop when you leave one tribe behind, you just become part of another tribe.\n"}

There’s no one right way to be a good leader; it takes a lot of skills in a lot of different areas. Learn the skills you do not have to become a better leader and work on the skills you do have.\nLive the vision of your team. Create a mission statement that helps all employees understand your vision for the company. It is important that you communicate the bigger picture while you help your team see how their roles play a part in the big ideas. It is a great way to offer direction and build a healthy professional relationship.\nHonesty is a crucial leadership characteristic. Good leaders should be trustworthy. As you work to develop your leadership skills, attempt to always set a precedent of honesty and trustworthiness. People will respect you in a leadership role if they know you’re reliable and trustworthy.\nLook for talent in your team. When you are in the process of looking for people to help you, it should be simple for you to decide who would give you the best benefit. That applies both to contracting people and hiring them.\nBe open about any issues that arise in a timely manner. Great leaders used to cover up problems; that isn’t the case anymore.

Address both their concerns and anything positive they have to say. You can learn something from anyone, no matter who they are. You will be shocked at what you learn by listening.\nYou must be able to communicate effectively and clearly with others. Make sure your team has the information they need to complete their tasks, including the deadlines. Check in here and there to make sure everyone is on track.\nLeadership is about developing methods you can use to effectively guide others to greatness.

Although at first it seemed small, the endeavor would end up having a bigger impact on their lives than they ever imagined.\nIn a country where a declaration of homosexuality at best raises eyebrows and at worst incites blind hatred and prejudice, “Srikandi” is a brave movie that sheds light on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community here.\nIt is especially unique because the filmmakers themselves are part of that community and were able to honestly convey their own experiences, feelings and thoughts on the screen.\nStea Lim, who is both a director and executive producer of the film, said the project was initiated by Laura Coppens, a German visual anthropologist who wanted to make a film about the struggles of Indonesian women. The project was realized with the help of the Goethe-Institut, the German cultural organization, and In-Docs, the documentary program of the Society of Independent Indonesian Films (YMMFI).\nCoppens said she began traveling to the region and Indonesia on a regular basis about five years ago.\n“This was basically because I am an Indonesian film curator and festival programmer for Asian Hot Shots Berlin, a festival for Asian independent cinema I founded with two friends in 2007 in Berlin,” she said.\nAfter becoming more involved with the regional cinema scene, Coppens realized there was a general lack of films about homosexual women, and there certainly weren’t any examples from Indonesia.\nShe found support from Berlin-based filmmaker Angelika Levi, who became a mentor and editor for the film. Together, the two have seen the project through from beginning to end.\n“She is an experienced filmmaker and a wonderful storyteller. It is mainly also because of her involvement and engagement that our film is as successful and beautiful as it is now,” Coppens said of Levi.\nThe diversity of the group members was key, Stea said.\nEight women, eight films. But the participants did more than simply work on their own stories. They acted in one another’s films, helped with narrative development and served as crew members.\nSrikandi not only makes an appearance in the title of the film, she also plays an active part in it: her story is told between the eight short films through Indonesian shadow theater scenes performed by puppeteer Soleh and singer Anik, two male-to-female transgender individuals from Surabaya.\nFor the women involved in the project, making “Srikandi” was a unique experience. Many of them had never done anything like try to make a movie.\nOne of the women is Edith, a political science student in Yogyakarta. She said she enjoyed being part of the project.\n“It was very exciting for me to learn how to make the storyboard, to think about the visuals, the images and the sounds, and how it all needs to be connected,” she said, adding that she could even imagine continuing with filmmaking in the future.\nAnother woman involved in the project, Winnie, looks at relationships and some of the typical prejudices she sees in society.\nThe filmmakers are well aware that “Srikandi” might draw criticism, but so far, the feedback has been positive.\nFriends who couldn’t afford to support the project with cash found other ways to help, donating time and energy to do things like assist with the lights or participate on the camera team, she added.\nWhile the film’s final cut has been completed, there is still post-production work to be done, primarily with sound and color. The group is still looking for funding to finance this final part of the project.\nThe group’s main motivation for completing “Srikandi” is to provide a platform for people to discuss a topic that is often deliberately overlooked.\nIt is undeniable that the film has already made an impact. In Germany it was selected as an official entry for the Panorama program at the Berlinale, Berlin’s international film festival, which will take place from Feb. 9 to 19.\nIn addition to “Srikandi,” the Berlin festival will showcase two other feature films from Indonesia: “Postcards From the Zoo” by Edwin and “The Mirror Never Lies” by Kamila Andini, as well as the short film “7 Deadly Kisses” by Sammaria Simanjuntak.\nThe eight “Srikandi” women welcomed the news about the Berlinale with much excitement and joy.\n“We are obviously ecstatic about it,” Stea said, adding that it was also quite overwhelming.\nJakarta (ANTARA News) - United Arab Emirates (UAE) Parliament Speaker Mohammad Ahmad Almour has praised Indonesia as an exemplary OIC (Organization of the Islamic Conference) member country for its consistent adherence to democracy and tolerant Islamic culture.\nThe West had often said that Democracy and Islam could not go hand in hand and that the two could even come into conflict with each other, said Hidayat citing Almour`s statement at the Islamic parliamentary meeting in Palembang.\n\"Although the majority of its population is Muslim, Indonesia consistently implements democracy and it is therefore the pride of OIC,\" Hidayat quoted Almour as saying.\nHidayat also said the United Arab Emirates parliament hoped Indonesia could play a more significant role in straightening out the West`s negative view of Islam in relation with democracy.\nTherefore many misunderstanding views about Islam can be reduced and Islam is not identical with terrorism.\n\"Indonesia is famous for treating quests in friendly, courteous and respectful ways. The chairman of the Parliament of UAE really appreciates this,\" said Marzuki Alie, Speaker of Indonesia`s House of Representatives on the same occasion.\nArab countries want the stigma of Islamic terrorism can be eliminated through Indonesian good relations with Europe and America.\n\"They thought Indonesia could be an agent for having good relations and appreciated by the US and Europe,\" he said.\nIndonesia can show that democracy is not contrary to Islamic values and Islam is not terrorist, but the violence arises recently only committed by a small group of extremists that does not represent Islam.\nA 38-year-old Indonesian security guard has been charged with assault after kicking a 20-year-old woman in the face after mistaking her for a predatory ghost.\nThe guard was on duty in Bandung, Java, when \"suddenly a figure, who was sitting on the floor and clad in white with hair covering the face, moved slowly in a weird way toward the elevator\", according to the Jakarta Post.\nThe guard \"sensed a threat to himself and the others in the elevator\" and kicked the ghost to the floor \"so that everyone ... could run and save themselves,\" the security officer's lawyer told the Jakarta Post.\nBut guard Sunarya's seemingly noble deeds have landed him more punishment than accolades, as the \"ghost\" turned out to be the 20-year-old daughter of a coal businessman who was in the hotel playing a \"ghost trick\" for a friend's birthday. She was later hospitalised for a bruised face and broken tooth.\nSunarya now faces charges of assaulting the girl, who was dressed as suster ngesot, a \"crawling nurse ghost\".\nThe Indonesian archipelago, while predominantly Muslim, is strongly influenced by spiritual and supernatural myths from its Malay, Hindu and Buddhist heritage. Common ghost sightings often refer to floating female figures dressed in white, with long hair and, sometimes, long fingernails.\nGhost and vampire movies are wildly popular in Indonesia (some erotic, many others homemade), but supernatural action is not confined to the screen. In December, at least 10 people were reportedly possessed by spirits after visiting a mahogany tree in Jakarta said to house a pocong (shrouded corpse ghost) and kuntilak (female vampire ghost). The tree had to be cut down and the religious affairs minister called in to calm hysterical crowds, but the spirits were reported to have merely moved on to a neighbouring tree.\nAs supernatural creatures in Indonesia can often take on terrifying forms – such as the jenglot, a mummified vampiric doll with fangs and long hair who feeds off human and animal blood – it is not surprising that many Indonesians approach ghosts with some trepidation.\nAs one reader, following Sunarya's story, wrote to the Jakarta Post: \"Sunarya should receive a medal, or at least be showered with honours, for acting so courageously in facing what he initially thought was a real ghost.\"\nBut the security officer remains modest. \"I have a wife and two little children, I hope everything will be fine,\" he told reporters. \"I just did my job as a security guard.\"\nAmid a wealth of off-field missteps and political bickering, Stefano Lilipaly provided a bit of good news for Indonesian football on Sunday.\nThe 22-year-old midfielder scored in the 66th minute of his debut for FC Utrecht in the Dutch top flight, becoming the first Indonesian to find the net in the Eredivisie.\nUtrecht drew 1-1 with visiting PSV Eindhoven after Ola Toivonen equalized in the 71st minute.\nHe played for the Netherlands’ Under-15 and Under-18 national teams, but he looked to his roots when the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) put out a call for talented youngsters of Indonesian heritage playing in Europe.\nStefano, whose father is Indonesian, was granted citizenship on Oct. 11, 2011, alongside fellow Dutch-born Jhonny Van Beukering and Tony Cussel and Nigeria-born Greg Nwokolo and Victor Igbonefo.\nHe was called up for Indonesia’s Under-23 tryouts to play in last year’s Southeast Asian Games, but he was cut by then-coach Rahmad Darmawan.\nUtrecht coach Jan Wouters praised the young midfielder for his development.\n“Lilipaly has developed very well, grown through the youth team and has shown his quality to us in this game,” he said.\nHowever, Aji Santoso, Indonesia’s new senior and U-23 head coach, said he did not want to rush in calling up Stefano for the national team’s next match – the final 2014 World Cup qualifier at Bahrain on Feb. 29.\nIndonesia is last in Group E with no wins and 16 goals conceded from five matches. Its last chance to reach the next round passed with a 4-1 home loss to Iran in November.\n“The Bahrain game will be our last match in the group and the results won’t decide anything. I prefer to call Stefano up for future events, such as the Suzuki Cup and the 2013 SEA Games,” Aji told the Jakarta Globe on Monday.\nStefano is one of a small but growing group of Indonesians playing in Europe. Yericho Christiantoko, Alfin Tuasalamony, Yandi Munawar and Syamsir Alam play in the Belgian second division with CS Vise, which is owned by the Bakrie family, while Arthur Irawan is trying his luck in Spain after signing with Espanyol’s U-19 team last year.\nIf those youngsters kept improving and played regularly, Aji said, they would help provide a brighter future for the national team. With world governing body FIFA prohibiting the PSSI from calling up players competing in the breakaway Indonesian Super League, the 41-year-old coach needs every option he can find.\n“I would love to see them playing in my team. I don’t think it will happen when we play against Bahrain, but it will be in the near future,” he said.\nDutch giants PSV.\nThey are holidays billed as an opportunity to enter another world, a chance to see the world's last primitive tribes up close in their natural environment.\nThe brochures tease and at times, critics say, titillate. Take the Delhi-based Aces Indian Tours, which invites visitors to travel to see the Bonda people, an ancient tribe found in the remote hilly regions of the state of Orissa. The website breathily offers to provide an insight into utterly different lives. \"On the northwest of river Machkund\", it states, \"live the wildest, rudest and possibly the most interesting tribe known as Bonda Tribe. The scanty dress of the Bonda women and homicidal tendency of Bonda males make them most fascinating people.\"\nIt is this kind of exotic invitation that has now come under unprecedented scrutiny in India, raising ethical issues that also apply to similar tours in other remote regions of the world.\nEvery year, thousands of western tourists visit India in search of the exotic. But two weeks after an Observer investigation exposed the degradation of \"human safaris\" in the Andaman Islands – which are in Indian territory – the country's travel industry has entered a bout of soul-searching. The Observer exposed video evidence that Jarawa tribeswomen had been bullied into dancing for convoys of visitors on the islands' main road. The reaction has been furious. Sonia Gandhi, leader of the ruling Congress party, has taken a personal interest in the 400-strong Jarawa's fate and is understood to be frustrated by the lack of action to protect them. At a meeting last week of the powerful National Advisory Council, which she chairs, members denounced the \"deplorable situation of the exploitation of the Jarawa tribe\".\nThe investigation has now prompted the home minister, P Chidambaram, to demand the interrogation of those responsible. He has flown to the Andamans to tell officials there to act swiftly to prevent further abuse of the tribe. Tribal affairs minister V Kishore Chandra Deo said: \"It's deplorable. You cannot treat human beings like beasts for the sake of money. Whatever kind of tourism is that? I totally disapprove and it is being banned.\"\nBut what about elsewhere in India, and in other parts of the world? In the case of the Jarawa, there is little doubt that the tribespeople have been exploited by unscrupulous locals and insensitive visitors. Elsewhere, ethical lines are usually more blurred, but the risk of damaging contact with vulnerable communities is very real.\nIn 1989, India introduced the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in an attempt to protect indigenous communities from \"indignities, humiliations and harassment\". But with the number of tourists across the world expected to hit a billion this year and previously inaccessible places beginning to open up for more and more people, how close should travellers be allowed to come to vulnerable communities?\nOne of the most popular destinations in India is Orissa, where tour operators promise sightings of the insular Bonda when the tribespeople leave their homes to go to a market in the village of Onkadeli. Entry into the Bonda's own villages is illegal: the tribe do not invite attention and many dislike being photographed, but the market offers a way to view them, and the tours continue. Even the state tourist board uses images of the tribe in its adverts.\nRoyal India Holidays, with offices in India and the US, offers a tribal tour of Orissa where it promises tourists can \"see the lifestyle of tattooed, heavily beaded, nearly naked tribal people, their day to day activity and their extremely primitive way of living\".\nThe company says it is recognised by India's ministry of tourism. Its brochure describes a trip to the Jeypore area of Orissa: \"After breakfast, an excursion to the nearby hills where most amazing and fierce Bondas Tribes (naked people) reside. They are also known as Remo meaning 'people'. The Bonda are generally semi-clothed, with the women characterised by the wearing of thick silver necklace bands. The tribe is one of the oldest and most primitive with their culture little changed in over a thousand years. The best way to view members of the tribe is by going to local markets held every Thursday.\"\nCompany owner Newton Singh told the Observer that most tours in Orissa focused on the tribes. He said he believed that the company was operating within the law but it relied on local agents in Orissa. He said he understood the objections and would review the tours. \"I don't want to do anything against the laws of humanity,\" he said.\nBhubaneswar-based Dove Tours offers a tour of Orissa in which, it explains, \"the area we visit is the home of the approximately 6,000 members of the fierce Bondas (naked people). They live in the remote hills and keep themselves isolated … They can only be seen when they come to trade at the local market, and we must time our visit to coincide with the weekly market day.\"\nGagan Sarangi, speaking for the company, said it operated within responsible guidelines and only dealt with tourists who would respect the tribe. He said foreign tourists were barred from the Bonda's area, but it was still possible to spot them in the markets. \"We are totally against any kind of unethical practices in the tribal area,\" he said.\nSurvival International, which campaigns on behalf of tribal peoples, is sceptical that such a high-minded approach is reflected by what takes place on the ground. The charity's director Stephen Corry said: \"We are now in the 21st century, not the 19th. Colonialism should be a thing of the past. Tribes are not cultural relics, nor should they be treated like animals in a zoo.\n\"They are not ancient or backward, but adapting like everybody around us to a changing world. This should entitle them to the same rights and freedoms as the very tourists who are taking their photographs.\n\"Promoting tours by using derogatory terms such as 'primitive', and advertising their 'nakedness', shows a clear lack of respect.\"\nCorry said tour operators had no right to promote tribal people as a tourist attraction. \"Forcing them to dance in return for sweets and biscuits, for the amusement of onlookers, is only possible where they're viewed as somehow less than fully human,\" he said. \"Sadly, the existence of human safaris in the Andamans is not isolated, but replicated in other areas of India. It is crucial tourists boycott such unethical 'attractions', so there is no fuel in the market to drive such tasteless practices.\"\nAssociation of British Travel Agents spokesman Sean Tipton said the travel industry recognised the necessity of regulating and monitoring interaction between tourists and tribes. \"Customers should always seek permission before taking photographs of indigenous people, or indeed any local people. This is a matter of courtesy and cross-cultural sensitivity.\"\nSue Ockwell, for the Association of Independent Tour Operators, was also keen to emphasise that its member companies were against the sort of \"tacky tourism\" seen in the Andamans. \"The aim of Aito is to ensure that host destinations and local people at tourism destinations benefit from tourism as well as those who take tourists,\" she said.\n\"Unfortunately, exploitation does still occur – from child prostitution to the type of practice described in the Andamans. It requires action by UK tour operators and associations such as Aito and Abta and it also requires action by governments in the destinations affected. It is only by working together that this sort of business can be stamped out.\"\nClearly, though, more needs to be done. Blogging about a visit to Onkadeli, one tourist noted that the attention of tourists was clearly unwelcome to some of the tribal people: \"There were a few tourists around (including myself) and truth be said, it all felt a little rude and intrusive! Some of the adivasis [indigenous tribes] were clearly uncomfortable with camera-wielding tourists, so I started to only take pictures with their permission. This would almost always result in my having to part with 10 rupees [about 13p]!\"\nBritish travel firm Audley Travel, winner of three Guardian-Observer travel awards for best small tour operator, offers tours to Orissa in which it promises sightings of the Bonda tribe, despite acknowledging that photographing them may be banned. The company said it firmly advocated responsible tourism and only took individuals or couples.\n\"They are accompanied by tour guides who are well briefed on the cultural sensitivity of the situation, particularly photography. Our clients themselves are intelligent, informed travellers whose last intention would be to 'gawp' at local people.\"\nMeanwhile, in the Andaman Islands, police say they have made some progress in identifying those responsible for filming the video publicised by the Observer, which is now believed to have been shot in September or October of 2008. \"The police team is questioning several tour operators and taxi drivers of the city in an effort to track down the source of the video,\" said S B Tyagi, superintendent of police. Officers have raided several shops in the town in an attempt to seize videos of the Jarawa that have been circulating among tour operators and which are sold to tourists.\nPolice announced on Thursday that a senior officer had been placed in charge of monitoring the road and said they had arrested two tour operators named in the Observer report.\nThe lieutenant governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Bhopinder Singh, has been ordered to take action to prevent further exploitation of the Jarawa. Tribal affairs minister Krishna Chandra Deo described the incident as \"disgraceful and a shame on all of us\" and said the tribe should be treated as humans, not aliens.\nAs the country digests the implications of the scandal, Corry said tourists considering visiting tribal areas needed to think very carefully about the long-term effects on tribal peoples, instead of the \"fleeting thrill of the experience or the glory of the story once back home\".\nA high-profile member of Indonesia’s large transgender community has registered to become a member of the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas-Ham).\nYulianus Rettoblaut, known as Mami Yuli or Mother Yuli, said on Friday that she was seeking to become a commissioner to fight for the rights to Indonesia’s ‘waria’ community, an Indonesian word taken from wanitia (woman) and pria (man).\nSpeaking at Komnas-Ham in Central Jakarta, Yuli said she would also fight for the rights of gay and lesbian communities as well as other heavily marginalized groups.\nYuli, head of the Communication Forum of Indonesia Transgender, said that high on her agenda was to allow transgender people access to school for a formal education to increase their career prospects.\nYuli has a law degree from Universitas Islam At Tahiriyah.\nAnother key issue was to fight for the rights of elderly transgender people who were often homeless and left to fend for themselves.\n“We will teach them skills such as baking cakes and other things so they can live independently and be productive,” Yuli said.\nFellow transgender activist Merlyn Sopjan said many transgenders were forced to quit school because they were mocked.\nShe said that while transgender people were treated better in the big cities, discrimination was pervasive.\nAn Indonesian civil servant who posted “God does not exist” on his Facebook page has been taken into police custody for his own protection after he was badly beaten.\nThe man, identified as Alexander, 31, now faces the prospect of losing his job, or even being jailed, if he fails to repent and accept one of six official state religions.\nBlasphemy carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail.\nLocal media reported that when Alexander arrived at work at the Dharmasraya Development Planning Board (Bappeda) on Wednesday, a group of men, also understood to comprise government officials, attacked and beat him before police arrived and took him into protective custody.\nAlexander was quoted by Padangekspres.co.id as saying that he did not believe in God because of the amount of crime and disasters.\nAlexander said he was born a Muslim but ceased religious activities in 2008.\nAziz said police would wait for a recommendation from the West Sumatra Coordinating Agency to Supervise Religion and Beliefs (Bakorpakem) as well as the Ministry of Religious Affairs before deciding on further action against Alexander.\nGusrizal Gazahar, head of the West Sumatera chapter of the Council of Ulema (MUI), told local media that if he refused to repent, Alexander should lose his job.\n“I want him to be fired,” he said.\n"}
