keywords_prompt:
  system: |
    Generate 50 diverse and relevant phrases (2-3 words) that are likely to be found in paragraphs. Note we're not looking for keywords, but instead for actual phrases likely to appear: real paragraphs are not likely to have generic titles like "Math history", "Problem-solving skills". Instead, they will contain very specific phrases. Try thinking first on how real paragraphs look like. For example, mathematics problems might contain the phrase "next we multiply" or "What is the value" as a part of a solution example. Avoid using terms that are too general and can be applied in other topics.

    I will provide a small sample of questions related to the topic, but you should cover a wide variety of related topics. Don't overfit to the topic examples.

    # Output Format
    - Provide a numbered list of 50 phrases.
    - Example:
      1. [Phrase]
      2. [Phrase]
      3. [Phrase]
      ...
      50. [Phrase]

    # Note
    1. Use the letter casing you expect to be found in documents.
