[ 1 ] popular rules of inference in propositional logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and contraposition. first - order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers. the standard form of rules of inference [ edit ] in formal logic ( and many related areas ), rules of inference are usually given in the following standard form : this expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well. the exact formal language that is used to describe both premises and conclusions depends on the actual context of the derivations. in a simple case, one may use logical formulae, such as in : this is the modus ponens rule of propositional logic. rules of inference are often formulated as schemata employing metavariables. [ 2 ] in the rule ( schema ) above, the metavariables a and b can be instantiated to any element of the universe ( or sometimes, by convention, a restricted subset such as propositions ) to form an infinite set of inference rules",

( colourful rubber balls isolated on white ( with clipping path ) image by marek kosmal from fotolia. com ) a \" bouncy \" ball is a small hard rubber ball that when dropped, bounces upward at a high velocity. there are some bouncy balls that reach the original height from which they were dropped or higher, while others don't quite make it there. to understand why a bouncy ball bounces so high, you need to learn a few of the basic laws of physics. other people are reading law of conservation of energy in order to understand the physics behind a bouncy ball, you'll have to first understand the scientific law of conservation of energy : energy cannot be created or destroyed. instead, energy just turns into another form of energy. so, for example, when you eat a carrot, the heat and light energy put into it by the sun turns into the chemical and electrical energy that powers your body, and enables you to pick things up - - for example, a bouncy ball. potential energy when you throw the bouncy ball into the air, you've transferred some of your energy into the ball. that energy isn't yet going anywhere, it's being held \" in potentia \" as potential energy, according to the university of virginia physics department. this energy can be held in the bouncy ball indefinitely - - it's not going to leak out because of the law of conservation of energy. only when the ball is released does that energy go somewhere. kinetic energy kinetic energy is the energy of motion. once you drop the ball, that potential energy turns into kinetic energy. gravity pulls the bouncy ball down, using that kinetic energy to drag the ball down to earth. in the split second when the ball hits the ground, the kinetic energy causes the ball to deform. here is where the material of the ball comes into play, with a rubber ball, it flattens at the bottom and spreads out somewhat. you'll rarely, if ever, will notice this deformation because it happens so fast. rubber is a material that can stretch out, but always tries to return to its original shape. whenever you squeeze a rubber ball, it always goes back to being",

( the second doesn't involve fractions, so if there's a different issue there, write back and tell me what trouble you had with it. ) first, let's eliminate fractions early. we can do that by multiplying by the denominator, 6 : 17 = 7 - ( 5 / 6 ) t 17 * 6 = ( 7 - ( 5 / 6 ) t ) * 6 17 * 6 = 7 * 6 - ( 5 / 6 ) t * 6 102 = 42 - 5 t do you see what i did? on the right i had to multiply the whole expression by 6, so i first put it in parentheses, and then used the distributive property so that i multiplied each term by 6. ( in reality i would do it in one step, but you probably aren't used to it yet. ) now the equation looks simpler, and you should be able to solve it. if there were two fractions in the problem, you could do this twice, once with each denominator. the other way is basically to forget that the numbers are fractions until the end ; just treat each fraction as a number and don't try to do anything to it yet",

            "text": "access matters : national broadband map reveals gaps 2. 22. 11 | the department of commerce \u2019 s national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) last week launched the first - ever national broadband map, available at www. broadbandmap. gov. the searchable map shows where broadband internet service is available, the technology used to provide the service, the maximum advertised speeds of the service, and the names of the service providers. the map also reveals that one - third of u. s. households still lack a broadband internet connection, and between 5 and 10 percent of people lack access to broadband at speeds that support basic applications, such as downloading web pages, photos and video. in addition, the ntia released the results of a new nationwide survey on broadband adoption that shows the persistence of some demographic disparities. among the highlights of the february 2011 digital nation report ( pdf ) : - broadband internet access at home continues to grow : 68 percent of households have broadband access, as compared to 63. 5 percent last year. ( in the survey, broadband was defined as internet access service that uses dsl, cable modem, fiber optics, mobile broadband, and other high - speed internet access services. ) - notable disparities between demographic groups continue : people with low incomes, disabilities, seniors, minorities, the less - educated, non - family households, and the non - employed tend to lag behind other groups in home broadband use. - while the digital divide between urban and rural areas has lessened since 2007, it remains significant. in 2010, 70 percent of urban households and only 60 percent of rural households accessed broadband internet service. ( last year, those figures were 66 percent and 54 percent, respectively. ) - overall, the two most commonly cited main reasons for not having broadband internet access at home are that it is perceived as not needed ( 46 percent ) or too expensive ( 25 percent ). in rural america, however, lack of broadband availability is a larger reason for non - adoption than in urban areas ( 9. 4 percent vs. 1 percent ). americans also cite the lack of a computer as a factor. - despite the growing importance of the internet in american life, 28. 3 percent of all persons do not use the internet in any location, down from 31. 6 percent last year. the new york times recently covered how this plays out in clarke county, ala., where about half of the 27, 867 residents don \u2019 t have fast, reliable internet access : \u201c ninety - five percent",

( another possible convention is to store the return value in a designated location in the calling stack frame. ) now let us relate the stack representation of environments to our understanding of the evaluation of programming languages with lexical scoping, i. e., the ( recursive ) let and lambda constructs. we have discussed lexical scope in the context of mostly functional languages based on the lambda - calculus, but exactly the same lexical constructs are present in algol - like languages. in algol - like language, a rec - let is called a block and a lambda",

( 909 km ) tops it. both are huge by asteroid standards, but undeniably small on the planetary scale ; vesta's modest mass, for example, gives it a gravity that's just 2 % that of earth. still, as artifacts of the long - ago stages of cosmic history ( or what nasa, elegantly describes as \" special fossils of the early solar system \" ), they have always been very tempting targets, and in 2007, nasa launched dawn an innovative, ion - propulsion spacecraft to reconnoiter them both. since july 16, 2011, the ship has been orbiting vesta, at altitudes as low as 125 mi.

( 2 ) a short vitamin supplement trial may not show any benefit simply because it takes a long time for a disease to develop or for the vitamin \u2019 s protective effects to emerge. 2. who were the study participants \u2014 and how healthy were their lifestyles? everyone knows that diet, smoking, exercise, and other lifestyle choices can have a dramatic effect on our health. these lifestyle characteristics can also have an effect on how our bodies respond to vitamins. a supplement is only useful to people whose diets are lacking in that specific nutrient ; a randomized trial that gives vitamin pills to well - fed participants may not show any results. similarly, people who smoke may have greater need for certain vitamins, so a study conducted on smokers could have different results from one conducted on people who never smoked or who have kicked the habit. 3. when did study participants take the supplement? a supplement may only be beneficial at one stage of a disease or condition and not another, so studies done at different stages may have different results. folate deficiency in mothers, for example, leads to neural tube defects, but folate supplements only protect against defects if taken in the first few weeks after conception. 4. how did researchers measure the supplement \u2019 s effectiveness? studies often differ in how they measure their outcomes \u2014 that is, how they measure whether a supplement had any benefit. heart disease, for example, covers a wide range of conditions, including heart attack, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease. if a study measures the effect of a vitamin supplement on heart disease overall, it may miss a supplement \u2019 s protective effect against stroke. for more information on how to understand news stories",

( philo, on the creation, 119 ) there is another saying of jesus in the gospel of mark that also comes to mind when reading the same work of philo, on the creation ( or opus mundi ). the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath. ( mark 2 : 27 ) the jesus seminar voted that this is something very like what jesus probably said. maurice casey ( aramaic sources of mark \u2019 s gospel ) discussed it at length to argue that \u201c the cultural context \u201d should inform readers that jesus implied that his use of \u201c man \u201d or \u201c mankind \u201d here was nonetheless applicable to jews only. he quotes the 1947 cnt ( presumably the commentaire du nouveau testament? ) to confirm that jesus would not have meant to include non - jews in this sabbath saying : as a matter of historical fact the sabbath was not made for man in general. at the time when the saying was uttered the sabbath was a distinctive peculiarity of the jews : and our evidence goes to show that they regarded it as such and resented any non - jewish observance of it.

[ if so, eden would have been quickly overrun and destroyed. ] contrary to popular belief, adam did not name millions of species of animals on day six ( cf. wells, 2001 ; mckinsey, 2000, p. 84 ). genesis 1 states that the animals were created \u201c according to their kind ( s ) \u201d ( vs",

( see the evolution theory. ) we may also question the truth of materialism's claim of using scientific methods. we can investigate whether or not matter has existed for ever, whether matter is capable of ordering itself in the absence of a creator, and whether or not it can give rise to life. when we do so, we see that materialism is actually in a state of collapse. the idea that matter has always existed collapsed with the big bang theory, which proved that the universe had come into being from nothing. ( see the big bang theory. ) therefore, the evolution theory - in other words, the claim that matter organized itself and gave rise to life - has also collapsed. the big bang, in which the universe began, is a phenomenon that refutes the claims of materialists and evolutionists and which confirms creation by showing that the universe had a finite beginning. however, materialist scientists refuse to abandon their position, even though they clearly see that science has refuted the theory of evolution, since their devotion to this philosophy is so important to them. on the contrary, they seek to keep materialism alive by supporting the theory of evolution in whatever way possible.... however, [ since ] materialistic philosophy does not permit us to see concepts such as \" mind \" or nonmaterial intelligence behind the origin of material life, it automatically became necessary to search for the source of language, code, mind, and information in biological cells exclusively within matter and the laws of chance. however, it is just this task",

( mitochondria carry dna of their own and their operation depends on a combination of proteins encoded locally and others encoded in the nuclear genome of a cell and imported. ) the mtfmt enzyme encoded in the mitochondrial dna is responsible for converting a transfer rna ( trna ) into a form used to initiate protein translation. without that enzyme, mitochondria fail to translate proteins efficiently leading to the symptoms recognized as leigh syndrome. studies in patient skin cells showed that the defects in translation could be corrected by replacing the mtfmt gene. although it isn't clear in the case of leigh syndrome whether a precise molecular diagnosis will necessarily lead to therapies, the current findings represent a meaningful advance. \" it can be very reassuring to families to have a definitive answer, \" thorburn says. \" they are often referred around from one doctor to another. a diagnosis at least provides some closure to the diagnostic odyssey even without a treatment. \" diagnosis of the disease along with its specific genetic cause can also be informative about the risk a couple has of having another affected child, he adds. the diagnostic information can help in decisions about whether and how to pursue alternative means of having children, for instance through the use of donor sperm or eggs. in addition to their clinical implications, the new findings offer insight into the",

( ketubot 67b ) the force of this passage lies in the fact that hillel himself was notoriously poor, yet he gave of his money and time to help a rich man who had lost his money regain his self - respect. is double aspect is evident throughout the laws of tzedakah. on the one hand, they are directed to the brute fact of poverty. no one must be deprived of basic physical necessities. on the other, they address with astonishing sensitivity the psychology of poverty",

( october 2009 ) | marriage as a public interest the ancient greek legislators considered the relation of marriage a matter not merely of private, but also of public or general interest. this was particularly the case at sparta, where the subordination of private interests and happiness to the public was strongly exemplified in the regulations. for instance, by the laws of lycurgus, criminal proceedings might be taken against those who married too late ( graphe opsigamiou ) or unsuitably ( graphe kakogamiou ), as well as against those who did not marry at all ( graphe agamiou ). these regulations were founded on the generally recognised principle that it was the duty of every citizen to raise up a strong and healthy progeny of legitimate children to the state. so entirely, in fact, did the spartans consider the teknopoioia ( childbearing ) as the main object of marriage, which the state was bound to promote, that whenever a woman had no children by her own husband, she was not only allowed, but even required by the laws, to cohabit with another man. on the same principle, and for the purpose of preventing the extinction of his family, the spartan king anaxandridas ii was allowed to cohabit with two wives, for whom he kept two separate establishments : a case of bigamy, which, as herodotus observes, was not at all consistent with spartan nor indeed with hellenic customs. thus the heroes of homer appear never to have had more than one kouridie alochos : lawfully wedded wife ; though they are frequently represented as living in concubinage with one or more. solon also seems to have viewed marriage as a matter in which the state had a right to interfere, for we are told that his laws allowed agamiou graphe, though the regulation seems to have grown obsolete in later times ; at any rate there is no instance on record of its application. plato too may be quoted to prove how general was this feeling, for according to his laws, any one who did not marry before he was thirty - five was punishable not only with atimia ( loss of civil rights ), but also with pecuniary penalties, and he expressly states that in choosing a wife everyone ought to consult the interests of the state, and not his own pleasure. selecting a spouse but independent of",
