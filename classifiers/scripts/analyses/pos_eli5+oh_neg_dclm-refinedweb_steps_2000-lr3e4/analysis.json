( lots of people have been converting the regular lx to look like the supercharged version which makes it seem like they made much more than 200 ) this also should not be compared to the supercharged lx 570, it will be produced in much larger numbers and will be priced less than the supercharged version. this is more like the 2010 - 2011 / 2014 - 2015 lx with the sport bodykit. i don't think this is all that polarizing looking, or at least not in the way the current rx and nx are often claimed to be. it's quite similar to the stock lx, just a little bit less boxy and with a much cooler version of the spindle grille. going to try to get this kit..... i love it.. view attachment",

( note that most of these exercises require a helper or manipulator because the muscles are at first too weak for the patient to make the motions himself. ) 2. lying face down, clasp the hands at the back of the neck and raise both elbows from the bed or table without raising the body. raise the elbows with someone putting pressure on them. 3. standing with the hands clasped behind the back, the fingers interlocked, the palms facing up, turn the palms in and down. 4. shrug the shoulders. 5. standing with the arms stretched out horizontally from the sides, move the arms in small and large circles in both directions, clockwise and anti - clockwise. 6. standing with the arms stretched horizontally out at the sides, rotate them so that the palms are alternately up and down. exercises for the elbow joint after injury or disease : in most instances the elbow will have been bent, and after injury being in a splint, will be more or less fixed in the bent position. 1. lie on the face, the forearm hanging over the edge of the table. the manipulator supports it and bends it back and forward. 2. sitting at a table with the back of the arm resting on it, raise the forearm until the hand touches the shoulder and then bring it back. the manipulator can make resistance both in bending and restoring. 3. sitting or standing with the arm at the side and a book in the hand, lift the book to the shoulder and bring it back. 4. sitting with the back of the upper arm resting on a table, the",

                "text": "greek medio - passive voice explained : lesson 5 in the last lesson, we learned how to conjugate the past continuous forms and now we will start learning how to do that for the past simple forms. the endings used in conjugating them are the same as the endings used in the past active voice so you will need to know them. you can just think of any active word in the past to get the past simple endings ( considering they are the same for both active and passive ). for example, how would you say : 1 translation : i understood and from that you get the past active and past passive ending for i which is \u03b1. try this : 2 translation : did you understand? 3 translation : the past passive and active ending for informal you is one more example : 4 translation : they did not see me and then : 5 translation : the past passive and active ending for they is and so on. i'm not going to mention them all and just remind you, if you still do not remember them perfectly, that : the past simple endings are as follows : \u03b1, \u03b5\u03c2, \u03b5, \u03b1\u03bc\u03b5, \u03b1\u03c4\u03b5, \u03b1\u03bd. ( quick tip : the endings sound kind of like \u03b1, \u03b5\u03c2, \u03b5, - i see, \u03b1\u03bc\u03b5, \u03b1\u03c4\u03b5, \u03b1\u03bd - am ate an. ) the main difference between active and passive simple past endings is that in the active the endings go bare \u03b1, \u03b5\u03c2, \u03b5, \u03b1\u03bc\u03b5, \u03b1\u03c4\u03b5, \u03b1\u03bd while in the passive the endings get \u03b7\u03baed : they get \u03b7\u03ba in front of them. so, in practice, the endings for the passive past are as follows : the passive endings get \u03b7\u03ba in front of so they are as follows : \u03b7\u03ba\u03b1, \u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, \u03b7\u03ba\u03b5, \u03b7\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5, \u03b7\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5, \u03b7\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd. this is nice for us too because we can safely state that whenever a word has \u03b7\u03ba in the ending, chances are it is the past tense of a passive verb. also, just like in the active past, the accent in the past always falls onto the third syllable from the end ( have that in mind! ). now let \u2019 s get to forming the past of the medio - passive which will be a more interesting task in itself. here is the thing : now our task is actually easier because we do not have to focus on b1 or b2 - all b verbs are conjugated",
