[ 1 ] ten of the fourteen participating nations earned medals, in addition to three medals won by mixed teams, i. e. teams made up of athletes from multiple nations. the united states won the most gold medals ( 11 ), while host nation, greece, won the most medals overall ( 46 ) as well as the most silver ( 17 ) and bronze ( 19 ) medals, finishing with one less gold medal than the united states. [ 2 ] in the early olympic games, several team events were contested by athletes from multiple nations.

( i added the numbers. ) \u201c i propose here the view that, ( 3 ) when the market fails to achieve an optimal state, society will, to some extent at least, recognize the gap, and nonmarket social institutions will arise attempting to bridge it. \u2026 it has always been a favorite activity of economists to point out that actions which on their face achieve a desirable goal may have less obvious consequences particularly over time, which more than offset the original gains. but it is contended here that the special structural characteristics of the medical - care market are largely attempts to overcome the lack of optimality due to ( 1 ) the nonmarketability of the bearing of suitable risks and ( 2 ) the imperfect marketability of information. ( 4 ) these compensatory institutional changes, with some reinforcement from usual profit motives, largely explain the observed noncompetitive behavior of the medical - care market, behavior which, in itself, interferes with optimality. the social adjustment towards optimality thus puts obstacles in its own path. \u201d ( p. 947 ) here is how i understand what that says. there are two reasons why efficient markets in health care and health insurance are difficult to establish : ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). when society encounters problems like that, ( 3 ) it develops ways to compensate for the problems. those compensating institutions move the society closer to an efficient outcome. however ( 4 ) the compensating institutions also make it more difficulty to have efficient markets in health care and health insurance. this is very complicated and i can \u2019 t say that i always followed the thread through his various examples. i think i understand how licensing, education requirements and the professional ethics of doctors are ways of responding to the problem posed by the consumer \u2019 s lack of knowledge. all your advice about",

( 2 ) interpret the problem : what is your interpretation of the event? to what extent does the interaction touch on gender and / or race issues?

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] different substructural type systems [ edit ] several type systems have emerged by discarding some of the structural rules exchange, weakening and contraction : \u2022 linear type systems ( allow exchange, not weakening or contraction ) : every variable is used exactly once. \u2022 affine type systems ( allow exchange and weakening, not contraction ) : every variable is used at most once. \u2022 relevant type systems ( allow exchange and contraction, not weakening ) : every variable is used at least once. \u2022 ordered type systems ( discard exchange, contraction and weakening ) : every variable is used exactly once in the order it was introduced. the explanation for affine type systems is best understood if rephrased as \" every occurrence of a variable is used at most once \". linear type systems [ edit ] linear types corresponds to linear logic and ensures that objects are used exactly once, allowing the system to safely deallocate an object after its use.

[ 4 ] linear type systems allow references but not aliases. to enforce this, a reference goes out of scope after appearing on the right - hand side of an assignment, thus ensuring that only one reference to any object exists at once. note that passing a reference as an argument to a function is a form of assignment, as the function parameter will be assigned the value inside the function, and therefore such use of a reference also causes it to go out of scope. a linear type system is similar to c + +'s unique _ ptr class, which behaves like a pointer but can only be moved ( i. e. not copied ) in an assignment. although the linearity constraint is checked at compile time, dereferencing an invalidated unique _ ptr causes undefined behavior at run - time.

( part 1 ), \" we set forth the various possible ways that assets can be titled. titling controls how an asset that you own will be distributed upon your death. if you own an asset in your individual name, this asset will most likely be distributed through the terms of your will through the court process called probate, or if you die without a will, through the process known as administration. if you own an asset that permits you to designate a beneficiary, such as a retirement account, that designation controls who will receive this asset when you die. if you own an asset with a co - owner, the form of ownership and the state where such ownership occurs will dictate to whom and how the asset will be distributed upon your death. this article will focus on the latter form of ownership, joint tenancy and real property you \" co - own, \" and examine the tax and other consequences that can arise from such co - ownership. what is it? in this article, joint ownership includes a right of survivorship. in most states, that means when you die, the surviving co - owner becomes the sole owner of the property automatically by operation of law. in some states, if real property is co - owned by a husband and wife, such as new york and florida, such property is deemed to have a right of survivorship, with no special language required. in other states, such as georgia, property must be titled in the name of the co - owners and indicate a right of survivorship, such as \" joint tenants with right of survivorship. \" in california, title held as \" joint tenants \" includes a right of survivorship without any added language. why do it? joint ownership is tempting because it assures that an asset you own will be received by the beneficiary of your choice and also assures that this transfer will not require court involvement. however, depending on the asset and the state where the asset is located, avoiding probate may not be a good enough reason to incur the potential negative outcomes of joint ownership. and avoiding probate may have consequences you didn't anticipate. if you and your spouse wish for the first deceased spouse's property to be held in a trust for the surviving spouse, property that is held as joint tenants with right of survivorship will bypass that trust and all the protections built into trusts. we will focus this discussion on joint tenancy with limited",
